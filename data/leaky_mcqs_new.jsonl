Likewise, at the hearing of his case on 2 April 2007 the applicant had again declared that he considered himself to be detained unlawfully and had kept trivialising his offences.\nHis personal circumstances could not lead to a different assessment either. His contacts outside prison had deteriorated as his relationship with his fiancée had ended. The applicant had subsequently insulted and threatened her.\nFurthermore, the applicant’s age and his state of health did not necessitate the suspension on probation of his preventive detention. The Regional Court had regard, in this connection, to a report dated 21 February 2007 submitted by the Aachen Prison doctor. The latter had stated that the applicant suffered from prostate cancer, which was being stabilised by hormonal medication. He had had an artificial hip fitted in October 2006 without any complications. It had also been possible to treat his heart disease with medication. The likelihood of the seventy‑four‑year‑old applicant dying in the years to come was slightly increased because of his illnesses.\nAccording to the Regional Court,", "chunk_private_tokens": 20, "chunk_private_ratio": 0.1, "chunk_char_start": 8992, "chunk_char_end": 10289, "chunk_private_spans": [{"label": "LOC", "text": "Aachen Prison", "text_normalized": "Aachen Prison", "doc_segments": [[8985, 8998]], "chunk_segments": [[0, 6]], "chunk_text": "Prison"}, {"label": "DATETIME", "text": "2 April 2007", "text_normalized": "2 April 2007", "doc_segments": [[9228, 9240]], "chunk_segments": [[236, 248]], "chunk_text": "2 April 2007"}, {"label": "DATETIME", "text": "21 February 2007", "text_normalized": "21 February 2007", "doc_segments": [[9799, 9815]], "chunk_segments": [[807, 823]], "chunk_text": "21 February 2007"}, {"label": "LOC", "text": "Aachen Prison", "text_normalized": "Aachen Prison", "doc_segments": [[9833, 9846]], "chunk_segments": [[841, 854]], "chunk_text": "Aachen Prison"}, {"label": "DEM", "text": "prostate cancer", "text_normalized": "prostate cancer", "doc_segments": [[9910, 9925]], "chunk_segments": [[918, 933]], "chunk_text": "prostate cancer"}, {"label": "DEM", "text": "hormonal medication", "text_normalized": "hormonal medication", "doc_segments": [[9957, 9976]], "chunk_segments": [[965, 984]], "chunk_text": "hormonal medication"}, {"label": "DEM", "text": "artificial hip", "text_normalized": "artificial hip", "doc_segments": [[9992, 10006]], "chunk_segments": [[1000, 1014]], "chunk_text": "artificial hip"}, {"label": "DATETIME", "text": "October 2006", "text_normalized": "October 2006", "doc_segments": [[10017, 10029]], "chunk_segments": [[1025, 1037]], "chunk_text": "October 2006"}, {"label": "DEM", "text": "heart disease", "text_normalized": "heart disease", "doc_segments": [[10096, 10109]], "chunk_segments": [[1104, 1117]], "chunk_text": "heart disease"}, {"label": "DEM", "text": "seventy‑four‑year‑old", "text_normalized": "seventy‑four‑year‑old", "doc_segments": [[10149, 10170]], "chunk_segments": [[1157, 1178]], "chunk_text": "seventy‑four‑year‑old"}], "question": "Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?", "options": ["19 May 2009", "16 July 2009", "2 April 2007", "30 January 1980"], "answer_index": 2, "answer_text": "2 April 2007", "answer_text_raw": "2 April 2007", "target_label": "DATETIME"}

It appears that shortly before his escape, he had lost his right leg in a bomb attack that struck a mosque in Chechnya.\nSubsequent to his departure from Russia, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant by the Russian authorities before the Cerkessk City Court on the following charges: (i) participation in an armed insurrection and membership of an armed organisation with the purpose of overthrowing the constitutional order and violating the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and (ii) possessing firearms and ammunition. It appears that the Cerkessk City Court issued a detention order in respect of the applicant in his absence.\nOn 24 January 2008 the applicant was taken into police custody in Istanbul in the context of an operation against al-Qaeda.
