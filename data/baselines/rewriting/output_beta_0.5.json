Concerning the details, the applicant, born unspecified and currently residing unspecified, was married to her husband in a year that isn't specified. They had a daughter in the same year they were married. By the end of a specific year, the applicant's husband left and took their daughter with him. A few months later, on an unspecified date, the husband filed for divorce at the court. Alongside, he filed for removal of the applicant from their shared home. The husband later altered his divorce and eviction requests during the case. On a certain date, the court ruled the husband should provide temporary financial support to the applicant. This amount was increased in subsequent court rulings. Eventually, the applicant requested that a certain court member withdraw from the case. This request was approved on an unspecified date. A court hearing took place at the beginning of a year, but the specific date isn't stated."

On an unspecified date, the trial court issued a judgment in the case. The applicant was found guilty of several offenses that took place sometime between two specified dates: storing and possessing large amounts of psychotropic substances, possessing equipment needed for making these substances illegally, and producing significant quantities of these substances, particularly amphetamines. It was determined that the applicant had worked with three other individuals, but he was not found to be the leader of a criminal organization. The court sentenced the applicant to a period of imprisonment and also imposed a fine. The details of the cases were judged on the basis of expert opinions from nine different specialists, including one prepared in collaboration with another entity. The court also considered statements from relevant parties and witnesses, the written testimonies of those involved, and official documents."
