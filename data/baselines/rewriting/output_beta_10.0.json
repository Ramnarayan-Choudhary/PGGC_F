Mr. X, who was born in 1980 and resides in Ankara, was represented by Mr. A, a lawyer from Ankara. Mr. Y, born in 1975 and living in Kütahya, was represented by Mr. B, a lawyer from Kütahya. The Turkish Government was represented by their Agent. On May 13, 2009, the President of the Second Section decided to notify the Government regarding these applications. At the same time, the merits of the applications would be examined (Article 29 § 3). The circumstances of the cases are detailed as follows: \n\nBoth applicants lost their sight in one eye and sustained leg injuries, respectively, during their mandatory military service. Following the refusal of the Retirement Fund to provide them with special disability benefits, they separately appealed to the Supreme Military Administrative Court. On October 6, 2005, and April 5, 2007, respectively, the proceedings were initiated."

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: The Lustration Act required individuals holding public positions like ministers and members of parliament to disclose if they had worked for or collaborated with the security services during the communist regime. The Act also covered judges, prosecutors, and other public officials. In May 1999, the applicant declared that he was not an intentional and secret collaborator of the communist-era security services. On May 11, 2005, the Commissioner of Public Interest began investigating the truthfulness of this declaration. During a hearing on June 2, 2005, the applicant explained that in the 1980s he was harassed by two security service officers but maintained that his relationship with the security service did not constitute secret and conscious collaboration. He claimed he ended all contact with the security services in August 1984. The applicant tried unsuccessfully to have eight witnesses from the security services heard. On August 8, 2005, the Commissioner submitted an application to the Lustration Chamber of the Warsaw Court of Appeal."

The prosecutor responded that no such warrant was present on that day. On December 6th, the body responsible for the investigation, as they no longer could proceed, redirected the case to the prosecutor’s office in Diyarbakır, due to having the appropriate jurisdiction. By the 21st of December, the Diyarbakır prosecutor requested that the applicant resume their investigation and give updates every three months. On June 5th, 2003, the applicants contacted the Van and Tatvan prosecutor offices to inquire about the progress of the previous ten years of investigation. On the 26th of June, the Van prosecutor’s office concluded that they lacked the necessary territorial jurisdiction to proceed with the investigation and accordingly passed the case."

The reasons included the following: the documents submitted in support of the extradition request did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down in the Convention on the Extradition of Criminals between Switzerland and the Republic of Argentina (see paragraph 32 below), since they contained no description of the offences with which the applicant was charged; as regards the two kidnappings of which he was accused by the Argentine authorities, which were moreover of a political character, Mr. Sanchez-Reisse was innocent; if extradition was granted, it would be contrary to Articles 3 and 6"

      "The applicant attended Dunderrow National School from 1968. The school was owned, through trustees, by the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Cork and Ross who was recognised by the Department of Education and Science (“the Department”) as the school’s patron.

Dunderrow was one of four national schools in the applicant’s parish.",

With regard to the reactor accident at Chernobyl, the Federal Council stated that the reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was technically not comparable to a light-water reactor like that of the Beznau II power plant. Furthermore the Chernobyl reactor had never undergone a safety review process as normally carried out in western countries. The Chernobyl power plant was therefore not relevant in the context of the assessment of the risks of western nuclear power plants. The Federal Council also pointed out that, in accordance with the Agreement of 10 August 1982 between the government of the Swiss Confederation and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on mutual information on the construction and operation of nuclear installations in the vicinity of the border, the German authorities had been provided with the relevant documents relating to the requested operating licence for the Beznau II power plant.

The applicant, using Article 17 of the Constitution (right to liberty and security), sought an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. Even though he did not contest his pre-trial detention, he objected to the high bail amount, considering it excessive and unreasonable based on his financial condition, which made any possibility of temporary release unlikely. He also claimed that the bail amount was determined without considering his personal circumstances and did not adhere to the court's previous rulings. In its detailed decision on September 29, 2003, the Constitutional Court deemed the appeal inadmissible.

Relying on Article 17 of the Constitution (right to liberty and security), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. While he did not appeal against his pre-trial detention, for which he considered sufficient reasons to have been given, the applicant complained of the amount set for bail, arguing that it had been excessive and disproportionate in view of his financial circumstances and had made any prospect of provisional release unrealistic. He alleged that the amount had been fixed without account being taken of his personal circumstances, in disregard of the requirements of the court’s case-law. By a reasoned decision (auto) of ________, the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible.

The compensation was in line with the civil liability set by Article V of the 1992 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage. The applicant, using Article 17 of the Constitution (right to liberty and security), sought an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. Even though he did not contest his pre-trial detention, he objected to the high bail amount, considering it excessive and unreasonable based on his financial condition, which made any possibility of temporary release unlikely. He also claimed that the bail amount was determined without considering his personal circumstances and did not adhere to the court's previous rulings. In its detailed decision on September 29, 2003, the Constitutional Court deemed the appeal inadmissible. The court noted that the applicant had been released prior to the ruling, a factor it applied in its consideration."

      "Over the ten years before 1986, the applicants had to move between a number of sites in Lancashire, often staying in unofficial stopping places. As they wanted to set up a family site, in 1986 they bought a piece of land, known as Cinderbarrow Malt Kiln, Yealand Redmayne, Carnforth in Lancashire. The site is 0.365 hectares in area, and is positioned in the countryside between the M6 motorway and the London-Carlisle railway line. When the applicants bought it, they stated that it was generally regarded as being an eyesore. They referred to letters from local residents describing the site as having been used for car breaking and tipping rubbish, being littered and infested with rats. They spent two years cleaning it up and developing it. The Government disputed this assertion, stating that local authority records indicate that it was after the applicants had occupied it that complaints were received about its condition. They stated that the land was previously used for grazing and growing crops.",

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nOn September 16, 1993, a new decision was issued refusing to restore two-thirds of the property to the applicants. They appealed. On June 17, 1994, the City Mayor overturned this decision, stating that the District Mayor should not have been involved as the District Office had previously sold part of the property to third parties that was the subject of the dispute. From 1994 to 1996, the case was inactive. After the applicants complained about administrative inactivity, the District Prosecutor filed a complaint with the Local Government Board of Appeal. On November 13, 1996, the Board of Appeal confirmed the complaint and demanded that the District Office provide a decision on the applicants' case by December 15, 1996. Meanwhile, on October 23, 1996, the District Office made a decision on the case merits, referring to the earlier decision stating that the District Office lacked competence to handle the transaction issues."
