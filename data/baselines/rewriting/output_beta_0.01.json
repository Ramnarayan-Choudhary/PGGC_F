The court held as follows: “... On the day of the President’s visit ... the defendant ... saw fit to wave a small placard containing an exact copy, served cold, of a famous retort prompted by a direct affront. If the defendant had not intended to cause offence, but solely to give an incongruous lesson in manners, he would surely have preceded the phrase ‘casse toi pov’con’ with words to the effect ‘you shouldn’t say’. Having adopted the phrase strictly as his own, he cannot reasonably maintain that he had no intention of causing offence. The apparently underlying issue of double standards does not even arise, since the purpose of the law is to protect the office of President, and Mr Eon, as an ordinary citizen, cannot claim the right to be treated on an equal footing.

Subsequently, the authorities asked the applicant to comment on these issues. He then provided his defense, stating that he was in a hurry to get his ill passenger home. He claimed he was driving at a maximum speed of 160 km/h and that he was using the left lane by frequently overtaking other vehicles. The applicant also stated that he did not use fog-lights. In a subsequent decision, the authorities found him guilty of four traffic violations: speeding, not driving in the right lane, improperly using fog-lights, and not carrying his driving licence. He was fined a total amount, with a possible jail term if he failed to pay. Additionally, he had to cover the procedural costs. Despite his explanation, the charges stood."

He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",
      "On 26 September 2007 the Samsun Assize Court acquitted H.Ö. of the charges against him. In its decision the court held that while the forensic medical reports established that the applicant had been ill‑treated between 5 and 6 October 1999, the applicant could not formally identify the accused as responsible and, as such, there was insufficient evidence"

He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicants were born in two unspecified years and live in an unspecified location. On an unspecified date around an unspecified time, the applicants, who were heading to a meeting known as the \"peace festivities\" organized by an unspecified entity in an unspecified park, were obstructed and searched by the police as they were about to enter. During this incident, the police found a bulletin in a black plastic bag. The police deemed the applicants suspicious and proceeded to arrest them. The applicants were allegedly subjected to physical assault, insults, and death threats during the arrest, including being pinned to the ground and subjected to punching, slapping, and the application of force to their necks. One of the officers also sat on the head of one of the applicants and struck her against the roof of the car."
