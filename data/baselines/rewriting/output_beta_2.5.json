On a specific date, the authority asked the applicant to comment on these charges. On another date, the applicant submitted his defence, claiming he needed to get a sick passenger home quickly. He mentioned he had been driving at a speed of up to 160 km/h and constantly overtaking cars, which led him to drive in the left lane. He denied using fog-lights. The authority found the applicant guilty of four traffic violations: speeding, driving in the wrong lane, improperly using fog-lights, and not carrying his driving licence. As a result, they imposed fines totaling a certain amount, along with  imprisonment if paid, and ordered him to pay procedure costs. The applicant repeated his defense."

In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: The applicants, born in unspecified years and residing in an unspecified location, attended a meeting called the \"peace festivities\" organized by unspecified entities at a particular park on an unspecified date around an unspecified time. They were stopped and searched by the police upon entering, and a bulletin was found in a black plastic bag. The police deemed them suspicious and arrested them. During the arrest, the applicants were reportedly beaten, insulted, and threatened with death. Specifically, the police restrained them by applying pressure to their necks, dragging them on the ground, and hitting them with wooden sticks. The police continued to punch and slap them and abused them once inside the vehicle, even sitting on one applicant's head."

His continued preventive detention on the basis of Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code, as amended in 1998, was constitutional. The criminal courts had further respected the principle of proportionality in respect of deprivations of liberty in their decisions. D. Subsequent developments On ________ the_____, reviewing the necessity of the applicant's continued detention, decided that the applicant was to remain in preventive detention as, owing to his criminal tendencies, he was still liable to commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims. On ________ the_____ quashed that decision and remitted the case to the_____. It found that the Regional Court had not sufficiently established the facts on which it had based its decision and had failed to hear the medical expert, who had submitted a report in writing on its request, also in person at the hearing.

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: In the matter of the time limit, the applicant's complaint regarding his continued preventive detention beyond ten years was deemed unfounded. The preventive detention, supported by the amended Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code in 1998, was found to be constitutional, as the criminal courts upheld the principle of proportionality in their rulings on detentions. Moving forward, on a specific date, the court reviewed the necessity of the applicant's continued detention, concluding that due to his criminal behavior, he posed a risk of committing severe offenses that could harm others significantly. Later, an appeal court ruled that the previous decision had inadequately considered the required evidence and failed to engage with a medical expert. The court also remanded the case for further consideration. Finally, on another date, the Federal Constitutional Court declined the applicant's request for review."
