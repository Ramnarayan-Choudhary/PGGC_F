      "6 November 2008 the Laval tribunal de grande instance found the applicant guilty of insulting the President and fined him 30 euros (EUR), a penalty which was suspended. The court held as follows: “... On the day of the President’s visit ... the defendant ... saw fit to wave a small placard containing an exact copy, served cold, of a famous retort prompted by a direct affront. If the defendant had not intended to cause offence, but solely to give an incongruous lesson in manners, he would surely have preceded the phrase ‘casse toi pov’con’ with words to the effect ‘you shouldn’t say’. Having adopted the phrase strictly as his own, he cannot reasonably maintain that he had no intention of causing offence. The apparently underlying issue of double standards does not even arise, since the purpose of the law is to protect the office of President, and Mr Eon, as an ordinary citizen, cannot claim the right to be treated on an equal footing. The offence of insulting the President of the French Republic has therefore been fully made out ...” As to the sentence, the court noted that in view of the applicant’s circumstances and modest income (EUR"

He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",
      "On 26 September 2007 the Samsun Assize Court acquitted H.Ö. of the charges against him. In its decision the court held that while the forensic medical reports established that the applicant had been ill‑treated between 5 and 6 October 1999, the applicant could not formally identify the accused as responsible and, as such, there was insufficient evidence"

According to the Government, telephone monitoring involved analyzing the College telephone bills to identify the numbers called and the details of call dates, times, durations, and costs. The applicant, however, thought that more detailed logging of call lengths, numbers of calls received and made, and the phone numbers of callers was also done. In at least one case, the Discipline Panel became aware of the name of a person with whom she had exchanged calls. The Government confirmed that telephone usage monitoring aimed to ensure proper use of facilities. The applicant maintained that her phone usage was monitored over an unspecified period. The Discipline Panel also monitored her Internet activities, which included noting which websites she visited, the times and durations of these visits."

In view of defence counsel’s refusal to accept the offer made by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to explain the content of the case files orally, the Regional Court found that it was impossible to assess whether the information given in this manner would be sufficient. At the present stage of the proceedings, counsel for the defence could not, however, claim to be entitled to unlimited access to the complete case files. The Regional Court’s decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on ________. 4. The Court of Appeal’s review of the detention order On ________ the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a further appeal against the detention order. He again claimed that he had a constitutional right to be given access to the facts and evidence on which the detention order was based.

Given the defense's decision not to accept the Public Prosecutor's Office's offer to explain the case files verbally, the Regional Court deemed it impractical to evaluate the adequacy of the oral explanation. The defense counsel, at this juncture, did not have the right to unrestricted access to the entire case files. Meanwhile, the Regional Court relayed its decision to the defense counsel. On a subsequent date, the applicant, with counsel, appealed the detention order further. He argued for his constitutional right to review the facts and evidence supporting the detention order. On another date, the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal without providing additional reasons. Following this, on yet another date, the Court of Appeal prepared a report, which was forwarded to the Court the very next day along with the case files."

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nThe applicant's detention due to the illegal possession of a firearm (as per section 254 of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 39 below) was confirmed. An appeal against this order was reportedly dismissed. On September 25 and an unspecified date thereafter, the applicant lodged his first applications for provisional release with Investigating Judge no. 1. He claimed that he was unaware of the true nature of the consignment and denied involvement with any drug-trafficking organization. He also complained that during his four-month detention, he was questioned by the judge only twice in May and an unspecified month, and was the only person still held despite the minor nature of his alleged offense. The applicant pledged to comply with any conditions attached to his release. His applications for provisional release were denied on October 9 and subsequent unspecified dates by orders without reasons. A similar application for provisional release was made on an unspecified date and was rejected on an unspecified date by a reasoned decision. The decision cited the severity of the offenses—illegal possession of a firearm and drug trafficking in large quantities—as the basis for the denial."

In 1961, a UK citizen, born in the early 1940s, was found guilty of robbery with violence and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. In 1969, while serving his sentence at a prison location on an unspecified date, a serious disturbance erupted in a recreational area where the individual happened to be present. On October 25, a prison officer who was involved in quelling the disturbance provided a statement identifying his attackers, mentioning that \"the individual was screaming... and another prisoner whom I recognize, possibly named.., and... another prisoner...\" On October 26, along with other suspects involved in the disturbance, the individual was separated from the main group of prisoners. On 28 October, events continued with unspecified details."

      "A. Background",
      "The following facts were not contested by the parties.",
      "The applicant attended Dunderrow National School from 1968. The school was owned, through trustees, by the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Cork and Ross who was recognised by the Department of Education and Science (“the Department”) as the school’s patron. The manager (S.), acting on behalf of the bishop, was the local parish priest. The latter being elderly and infirm, a local priest (Ó.) was the de facto manager who acted on behalf of, and in the interests of, S. The term “manager” used below refers both to Ó. and to the management function he performed. Dunderrow National School had two teachers, one of whom (L.H.) was the school’s principal, a married man. Dunderrow was one of four national schools in the applicant’s parish.",
      "In 1971 a parent of a child complained to the manager that L.H. had sexually abused her child. That complaint was not reported to the police, to the Department or to any other State authority and was not acted upon by the manager.",

On a certain date, the prosecution filed a bill of indictment against the applicant and seven others, accusing the applicant of participating in an organized and armed criminal group, inciting murder, deriving profits from prostitution, extortion, and unlawful possession of a firearm. A legal-aid counsel was assigned to the applicant by the trial court. On another date, the court extended the applicant's detention, citing the potential severity of the charges. On yet another date, the Regional Court ordered that the applicant and his co-accused remain in custody until a specific future date, based on the severity of the anticipated charges. The court noted that evidence, including witness statements, indicated the accused's involvement in criminal activities."
