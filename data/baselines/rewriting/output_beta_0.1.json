      "6 November 2008 the Laval tribunal de grande instance found the applicant guilty of insulting the President and fined him 30 euros (EUR), a penalty which was suspended. The court held as follows: “... On the day of the President’s visit ... the defendant ... saw fit to wave a small placard containing an exact copy, served cold, of a famous retort prompted by a direct affront. If the defendant had not intended to cause offence, but solely to give an incongruous lesson in manners, he would surely have preceded the phrase ‘casse toi pov’con’ with words to the effect ‘you shouldn’t say’. Having adopted the phrase strictly as his own, he cannot reasonably maintain that he had no intention of causing offence. The apparently underlying issue of double standards does not even arise, since the purpose of the law is to protect the office of President, and Mr Eon, as an ordinary citizen, cannot claim the right to be treated on an equal footing.

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: During good visibility conditions, the applicant had activated his fog-lights, and failed to present his driving licence when asked. Subsequently, the authorities requested the applicant to comment on the allegations. He replied that he had been in a rush because his passenger was unwell and he wanted to reach home quickly. He said his speed was around 160 km/h and he was frequently overtaking other vehicles, hence driving in the left lane. He also maintained he did not use his fog-lights. In a decision, the court found him guilty of four violations including speeding, failing to maintain the right lane, and using non-justified fog-lights, and fined him a total of unspecified amount without imprisonment. Additionally, the applicant was ordered to cover procedural expenses."

He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",
      "On 26 September 2007 the Samsun Assize Court acquitted H.Ö. of the charges against him. In its decision the court held that while the forensic medical reports established that the applicant had been ill‑treated between 5 and 6 October 1999, the applicant could not formally identify the accused as responsible and, as such, there was insufficient evidence"

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nIn foreign countries and faced with a severe sentence, a case was considered where the defense counsel refused to accept an oral explanation offered by the Public Prosecutor’s Office regarding the case files. Due to this refusal, the Regional Court concluded it was impractical to evaluate the adequacy of the oral explanation. As of the current stage of the trial, the defense counsel could not assert a claim for unrestricted access to all case files. The decision of the Regional Court was delivered to the defense counsel's representative on the unspecified date.\n\nThe Court of Appeal reviewed the detention order on the date not specified. The applicant, through their counsel, appealed the detention order once more, arguing that they had a constitutional right to review the facts and evidence behind the detention order. The Court of Appeal, without offering further justification, upheld its initial decision on the unspecified date. On the following day, the Court of Appeal, which had access to the case files, prepared a report that was sent to the other party with the files attached."

      "The following facts were not contested by the parties.",
      "The applicant attended Dunderrow National School from 1968. The school was owned, through trustees, by the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Cork and Ross who was recognised by the Department of Education and Science (“the Department”) as the school’s patron. The manager (S.), acting on behalf of the bishop, was the local parish priest. The latter being elderly and infirm, a local priest (Ó.) was the de facto manager who acted on behalf of, and in the interests of, S. The term “manager” used below refers both to Ó. and to the management function he performed. Dunderrow National School had two teachers, one of whom (L.H.) was the school’s principal, a married man. Dunderrow was one of four national schools in the applicant’s parish.",
      "In 1971 a parent of a child complained to the manager that L.H. had sexually abused her child. That complaint was not reported to the police, to the Department or to any other State authority and was not acted upon by the manager.",
