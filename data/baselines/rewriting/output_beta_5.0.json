He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",

In its decision the court held that while the forensic medical reports established that the applicant had been ill‑treated between 5 and 6 October 1999, the applicant could not formally identify the accused as responsible and, as such, there was insufficient evidence"

In view of defence counsel’s refusal to accept the offer made by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to explain the content of the case files orally, the Regional Court found that it was impossible to assess whether the information given in this manner would be sufficient. At the present stage of the proceedings, counsel for the defence could not, however, claim to be entitled to unlimited access to the complete case files. The Regional Court’s decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on ________. 4. The Court of Appeal’s review of the detention order On ________ the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a further appeal against the detention order. He again claimed that he had a constitutional right to be given access to the facts and evidence on which the detention order was based. On ________ the_______ decided, without giving further reasons, not to amend its decision of _______. On ________ the_________, which had the case files, drafted a report which was sent to the_______ with the files the next day. \nParaphrase the above text.

Due to the defense attorney declining the Public Prosecutor’s Office's offer to explain the case files verbally, the Regional Court concluded that it was impractical to evaluate if this oral explanation would suffice. During this judicial process, the defense lawyer could not assert a claim to unrestricted access to the entire case files. On an unspecified date, the Regional Court's decision was communicated to the lawyer's legal representative. On a later unspecified date, the applicant, with the help of counsel, appealed the detention order, emphasizing his constitutional right to know the facts and evidence backing the order. The Court of Appeal did not revise its earlier decision on the same unspecified date but sent the case files to the other party the following day."

The essence of the case can be summarized as follows: In 1965, a United Kingdom citizen, born in 1923, was found guilty of robbery with violence and sentenced to fifteen years in a UK prison. In 1969, he was incarcerated at an unspecified prison in the UK. On the evening of October 24, 1969, a significant disruption erupted in the recreation area where the prisoner was stationed. Subsequently, on October 25, a prison guard named Harry Johnson, who had played a role in neutralizing the disturbance and was injured in the process, gave a statement identifying his attackers, which included: \"The prisoner was shouting, and there were Johnson, a prisoner known to me by sight, and another individual I believe is named Lee.\" On October 26, the individual and other prisoners suspected of involvement in the riot were separated from the rest of the prison population.

      "A. Background",
      "The following facts were not contested by the parties.",
      "The applicant attended Dunderrow National School from 1968. The school was owned, through trustees, by the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Cork and Ross who was recognised by the Department of Education and Science (“the Department”) as the school’s patron. The manager (S.), acting on behalf of the bishop, was the local parish priest. The latter being elderly and infirm, a local priest (Ó.) was the de facto manager who acted on behalf of, and in the interests of, S. The term “manager” used below refers both to Ó. and to the management function he performed. Dunderrow National School had two teachers, one of whom (L.H.) was the school’s principal, a married man. Dunderrow was one of four national schools in the applicant’s parish.",
      "In 1971 a parent of a child complained to the manager that L.H. had sexually abused her child. That complaint was not reported to the police, to the Department or to any other State authority and was not acted upon by the manager.",

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nThe two parties had the same reporting structure as mentioned in paragraph 16 (3) above. The judge advocate for the general court-martial was chosen by the Judge Advocate General according to paragraphs 42 to 45. This judge advocate was a barrister and assistant judge advocate from the Judge Advocate General’s Office. During the court-martial, which took place on a specific date, the individual appeared before the court-martial at the Regent's Park Barracks in London. He was represented by a solicitor and pleaded guilty to several charges: three counts of common assault (a civilian offense), two counts of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline (a military offense), and two counts of threatening to kill (a civilian offense). On a previous date, his solicitor requested the presence of the witness at the court-martial in written form. The prosecuting officer then issued a witness summons for this individual's appearance on another date. Despite this, the defense learned on the morning of the hearing that the witness would not be present. The individual claims that this absence influenced his decision to plead guilty to the charges. However, it was not the solicitor's request for an adjournment."
