This must be sufficient to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also a minimum standard of living. In this way the legitimate interest of the public authorities in preventing the family from becoming a burden on the social security services is also taken into account. Mr Gül’s net monthly income is CHF 2,060, which falls CHF 650 short of the amount required for the minimum standard of living as calculated by the social security services. The cost of keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children’s home has not been taken into account, as it is not known who pays for this. The calculation of income is based on pay-slips from 1989, the latest available. On 23 October 1990 the Liestal Cantonal Hospital sent the Basle Rural Aliens Police a medical certificate stating that Mr Gül was 100% unfit for work and would remain so for a period that it was not possible to determine.

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nFinancial support is determined based on base rates that establish the monthly living expenses for a foreigner and their family members seeking to join them. These expenses need to be fully covered by the foreigner's income, which must be enough to meet basic necessities and at least a minimum standard of living. This is done to ensure that the public authorities are not burdened by the family's social security needs. Mr. Gül earns a net monthly income of CHF 2,060, which is CHF 650 less than what is required to meet the minimum standard of living according to social security calculations. The cost of keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children's home is not considered because it is unclear who bears this expense. Mr. Gül's most recent pay-slips, from 1989, are used in the income calculation. On October 23, 1990, the Liestal Cantonal Hospital issued a medical certificate stating that Mr. Gül was 100% unfit for work and that the duration of his inability to work could not be determined."

Meanwhile, in a decision (auto de procesamiento) of 2 February 1993, the investigating judge in Puerto de la Cruz had formally charged the applicant with, inter alia, rape and forgery of documents. On 8 February 1993 the investigating judge renewed his request to have a further statement by the complainant through the channels of international judicial cooperation (see paragraph 11 above). The requested statement and two medical certificates, all in Finnish, were received in Puerto de la Cruz on 29 April 1993. A Spanish translation did not become available until two months later.

In a decision of 22 May 2007, which became final on 20 July of that year, the Üsküdar Family Court (Istanbul) authorised the applicant, who was then single, to adopt a child, E., born on 5 November 2003 to Ms S.Ö. Consequently, under Article 314 §§ 2 and 3 of the Civil Code (no. 4721), “Gözüm” was registered as the surname of E. in the register of births and on the child’s identity documents.

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nThe case was represented by Ms Habibe Yılmaz Kayar, a lawyer based in Istanbul, for the applicant, and the Turkish Government was represented by their Agent. The applicant, born in 1966 and residing in Istanbul, claimed that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, either alone or in conjunction with Article 14, due to the national authorities' refusal to list her given name as the mother of her adopted child, E., on the civil register of births. The application's notice was provided to the Government on August 31, 2012.\n\nIn the details of the case, the applicant went through a single parent adoption process for a child named E., who was born on November 5, 2003, to Ms S.Ö. As a result, the Civil Code (no. 4721), specifically under Article 314 §§ 2 and 3, registered \"Gözüm\" as the surname of E. in the birth register and on his identity documents. Nevertheless, the registrar declined to include the applicant's given name alongside the name \"S.\" in the \"mother\" section of her adopted child's birth record."

He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",
      "On 26 September 2007 the Samsun Assize Court acquitted H.Ö. of the charges against him. In its decision the court held that while the forensic medical reports established that the applicant had been ill‑treated between 5 and 6 October 1999, the applicant could not formally identify the accused as responsible and, as such, there was insufficient evidence"

The applicant also believed that there had been detailed and comprehensive logging of the length of calls, the number of calls received and made, and the telephone numbers of individuals calling her. She stated that on at least one occasion the DP became aware of the name of an individual with whom she had exchanged incoming and outgoing telephone calls.

The applicant contended that her telephone usage was monitored over a period of about eighteen months until November 1999.",

Arguing that he had throughout been unaware of the real nature of the consignment, he insisted that he was not involved with any drug-trafficking organisation. He further complained that during his four-month detention he had only been questioned twice by the judge - in May and June 1989 - and was the only person still held in custody despite the relatively minor character of his offence. Mr van der Tang also undertook to comply with any conditions attached to his release. These applications were rejected on 9 October and 25 November 1989 respectively by means of orders not containing reasons.",

At the hearings, the Government produced certain documents to the Court AS TO THE FACTS The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. In 1965, Mr. Sidney Elmer Golder, a United Kingdom citizen born in 1923, was convicted in the United Kingdom of robbery with violence and was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. In 1969, Golder was serving his sentence in Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight. On the evening of 24 October 1969, a serious disturbance occurred in a recreation area of the prison where Golder happened to be. On 25 October, a prison officer, Mr. Laird, who had taken part and been injured in quelling the disturbance, made a statement identifying his assailants, in the course of which he declared: “Frazer was screaming ... and Frape, Noonan and another prisoner whom I know by sight, I think his name is Golder ... were swinging vicious blows at me.“ On 26 October Golder, together with other prisoners suspected of having participated in the disturbance, was segregated from the main body of prisoners.

In 1969, while he was serving his sentence at Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight, a disturbance broke out in a recreation area where Golder was present. On 25 October, a prison officer named Mr. Laird, who had been involved in quelling the disturbance and was injured, identified his attackers. In the statement, he mentioned that Frazer was shouting, while Frape, Noonan, and another prisoner, whom Mr. Laird recognized but did not know the name of, were aggressively attacking him. Following this, on 26 October, Golder and other prisoners suspected of taking part in the disturbance were separated from the rest of the inmate population. The incident then proceeded with further events on 28 October, though these are not fully detailed in the provided text."

The reasons included the following: the documents submitted in support of the extradition request did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down in the Convention on the Extradition of Criminals between Switzerland and the Republic of Argentina (see paragraph 32 below), since they contained no description of the offences with which the applicant was charged; as regards the two kidnappings of which he was accused by the Argentine authorities, which were moreover of a political character, Mr. Sanchez-Reisse was innocent; if extradition was granted, it would be contrary to Articles 3 and 6"

During his detention, he signed statements and admitted to being a member of the PKK and gathering funds for the organization. He was due to be questioned by the prosecutor on December 30, 1994."

These implementations were stricter, as non-compliant subsonic jets were banned from the domestic register earlier than stipulated by the Directive. Other orders introduced further ICAO noise standards. In setting landing charges, the system considers ICAO noise certification standards to promote quieter aircraft usage. Since certain restrictions have been imposed on jet night movements, the aim is to eventually end noisier jet flights during the night. These measures were adopted after considering research on the impact of aircraft noise on sleep and discussing with all relevant parties. Aircraft noise monitoring on takeoff at a specific location first began in the early 2000s. Since 2010, an automated system with thirteen noise monitoring terminals, connected to a central processing and control unit, has been in operation.",

It also enforced the European Community Directives from 1979 and 1983 on noise emissions from subsonic aircraft, with stricter implementation dates for non-compliant subsonic jets. Landing charges at Heathrow Airport now consider ICAO noise certification standards to promote quieter aircraft usage. Since 1971, there have been limitations on night flights for noisier jets to progressively stop night flights. These policies were developed based on studies linking aircraft noise to sleep disruption and after engaging with all stakeholders, including the Federation of Heathrow Anti-Noise Groups. Aircraft noise from take-offs was initially monitored in the early 1960s, with automatic equipment - thirteen noise monitoring terminals linked to a central processing unit - being used from 1974 onwards.",

These implementations were stricter, as non-compliant subsonic jets were banned from the domestic register earlier than stipulated by the Directive. Other orders introduced further ICAO noise standards. In setting landing charges, the system considers ICAO noise certification standards to promote quieter aircraft usage. Since certain restrictions have been imposed on jet night movements, the aim is to eventually end noisier jet flights during the night. These measures were adopted after considering research on the impact of aircraft noise on sleep and discussing with all relevant parties. Aircraft noise monitoring on takeoff at a specific location first began in the early 2000s. Since 2010, an automated system with thirteen noise monitoring terminals, connected to a central processing and control unit, has been in operation.",

In doing so, the 1984 Order also implemented the requirements of the European Community Directives of 1979 and 1983 on “Limitation of Noise Emission from Subsonic Aircraft“. It was, however, more stringent in its application inasmuch as non-compliant subsonic jets were banned from the domestic register twelve months earlier than required by the 1979 Directive. Orders of 1986 and 1987 introduced further ICAO standards. In structuring its landing charges, Heathrow Airport Limited has taken account of ICAO noise certification standards to encourage the use of quieter aircraft. Since 1971 restrictions have been placed on night movements of jets, with the aim of phasing out night flights of noisier aircraft. These measures have been adopted in the light of research into the relationship between aircraft noise and sleep disturbance and after consultation of all interested parties, including the Federation of Heathrow Anti-Noise Groups to which the applicants belong. Monitoring of aircraft noise on take-off from Heathrow Airport was first carried out in the early 1960’s.

It also enforced the European Community Directives from 1979 and 1983 on noise emissions from subsonic aircraft, with stricter implementation dates for non-compliant subsonic jets. Landing charges at Heathrow Airport now consider ICAO noise certification standards to promote quieter aircraft usage. Since 1971, there have been limitations on night flights for noisier jets to progressively stop night flights. These policies were developed based on studies linking aircraft noise to sleep disruption and after engaging with all stakeholders, including the Federation of Heathrow Anti-Noise Groups. Aircraft noise from take-offs was initially monitored in the early 1960s, with automatic equipment - thirteen noise monitoring terminals linked to a central processing unit - being used from 1974 onwards."

With regard to the reactor accident at Chernobyl, the Federal Council stated that the reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was technically not comparable to a light-water reactor like that of the Beznau II power plant. Furthermore the Chernobyl reactor had never undergone a safety review process as normally carried out in western countries. The Chernobyl power plant was therefore not relevant in the context of the assessment of the risks of western nuclear power plants. The Federal Council also pointed out that, in accordance with the Agreement of 10 August 1982 between the government of the Swiss Confederation and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on mutual information on the construction and operation of nuclear installations in the vicinity of the border, the German authorities had been provided with the relevant documents relating to the requested operating licence for the Beznau II power plant. From the beginning, this subject had been discussed during the sessions"

The inquest began on January 4, 1995, with the applicant and his family represented by a solicitor and counsel, while the RUC were represented. The Coroner heard testimony from 19 witnesses over three and a half days, including the applicant, eight civilians, Soldiers V, W, and X, and seven police officers."

      "Over the ten years before 1986, the applicants had to move between a number of sites in Lancashire, often staying in unofficial stopping places. As they wanted to set up a family site, in 1986 they bought a piece of land, known as Cinderbarrow Malt Kiln, Yealand Redmayne, Carnforth in Lancashire. The site is 0.365 hectares in area, and is positioned in the countryside between the M6 motorway and the London-Carlisle railway line. When the applicants bought it, they stated that it was generally regarded as being an eyesore. They referred to letters from local residents describing the site as having been used for car breaking and tipping rubbish, being littered and infested with rats. They spent two years cleaning it up and developing it. The Government disputed this assertion, stating that local authority records indicate that it was after the applicants had occupied it that complaints were received about its condition. They stated that the land was previously used for grazing and growing crops.",
