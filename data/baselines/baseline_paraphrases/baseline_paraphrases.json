In this way the legitimate interest of the public authorities in preventing the family from becoming a burden on the social security services is also taken into account. Mr Gül’s net monthly income is CHF 2,060, which falls CHF 650 short of the amount required for the minimum standard of living as calculated by the social security services. The cost of keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children’s home has not been taken into account, as it is not known who pays for this. The calculation of income is based on pay-slips from 1989, the latest available. On 23 October 1990 the Liestal Cantonal Hospital sent the Basle Rural Aliens Police a medical certificate stating that Mr Gül was 100% unfit for work and would remain so for a period that it was not possible to determine.

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nThe financial support determines the base living expenses for a foreigner and their family members, who want to join him. His income must cover not just essentials but also a minimum standard of living. This helps ensure the family does not become a burden on social services. Mr. Gül's net monthly income is CHF 2,060, which is CHF 650 less than the required amount for a minimum standard of living according to social security services. The expenses for keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children’s home have not been considered as it is uncertain who pays for this. Income is calculated using 1989 pay-slips, the most recent available. On October 23, 1990, the Liestal Cantonal Hospital issued a medical certificate indicating that Mr. Gül was 100% unfit for work and that the period of unfitness could not be determined."

Meanwhile, in a decision (auto de procesamiento) of 2 February 1993, the investigating judge in Puerto de la Cruz had formally charged the applicant with, inter alia, rape and forgery of documents. On 8 February 1993 the investigating judge renewed his request to have a further statement by the complainant through the channels of international judicial cooperation (see paragraph 11 above). The requested statement and two medical certificates, all in Finnish, were received in Puerto de la Cruz on 29 April 1993. A Spanish translation did not become available until two months later. The statement - which was taken at a court hearing in Tuusula, Finland, on 14 December 1992 - confirmed Ms T.’s original allegations (see paragraph 7 above).

On 31 August 2012 notice of the application was given to the Government. THE FACTS I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Istanbul. In a decision of 22 May 2007, which became final on 20 July of that year, the Üsküdar Family Court (Istanbul) authorised the applicant, who was then single, to adopt a child, E., born on 5 November 2003 to Ms S.Ö. Consequently, under Article 314 §§ 2 and 3 of the Civil Code (no. 4721), “Gözüm” was registered as the surname of E. in the register of births and on the child’s identity documents. However, the registrar refused to indicate the applicant’s forename under the heading “mother”, where the name “S.” was retained, this being \nParaphrase the above text.

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nMs Habibe Yılmaz Kayar, a lawyer based in Istanbul, represented the applicant. The Turkish Government were represented by their Agent. The applicant claimed that the national authorities refused to include her forename as the mother's name when registering the birth of her adopted child, which resulted in a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, alone or together with Article 14. Notification of the application was given to the Government on 31 August 2012. \n\nThe facts indicate that the applicant, born in 1966 and residing in Istanbul, was granted permission to adopt a child named E. on 22 May 2007. This decision became final on 20 July of the same year. E. was born on 5 November 2003 to Ms S.Ö. Subsequently, pursuant to Article 314 §§ 2 and 3 of the Civil Code (no. 4721), “Gözüm” was registered as E.'s surname in the birth registry. However, the registrar did not list the applicant's forename as the mother, instead retaining the name “S.”."

He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",
      "On 26 September 2007 the Samsun Assize Court acquitted H.Ö. of the charges against him. In its decision the court held that while the forensic medical reports established that the applicant had been ill‑treated between 5 and 6 October 1999, the applicant could not formally identify the accused as responsible and, as such, there was insufficient evidence"

Arguing that he had throughout been unaware of the real nature of the consignment, he insisted that he was not involved with any drug-trafficking organisation.

The reasons included the following: the documents submitted in support of the extradition request did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down in the Convention on the Extradition of Criminals between Switzerland and the Republic of Argentina (see paragraph 32 below), since they contained no description of the offences with which the applicant was charged; as regards the two kidnappings of which he was accused by the Argentine authorities, which were moreover of a political character, Mr. Sanchez-Reisse was innocent; if extradition was granted, it would be contrary to Articles 3 and 6"

Monitoring of aircraft noise on take-off from Heathrow Airport was first carried out in the early 1960’s. Since 1974 automatic equipment, consisting of thirteen noise monitoring terminals linked to a central processing and control unit, has \nParaphrase the above text.

Here is the paraphrased document without underscores or placeholders: \n\nThe 1984 Order was introduced to align with new ICAO standards and recommendations from the European Civil Aviation Conference. This order also applied stricter regulations than the 1979 Directive by banning non-compliant subsonic jets from the domestic register a year earlier. Further ICAO standards were implemented in 1986 and 1987. Heathrow Airport Limited has used ICAO noise certification standards in setting its landing charges to promote quieter aircraft usage. Night restrictions were put on jet movements since 1971 to reduce noisier aircraft in nighttime. These policies were based on noise and sleep disturbance research and were developed after consulting various groups, including Heathrow Anti-Noise Groups. Aircraft noise monitoring during take-off began in the early 1960s, and by 1974, thirteen noise monitoring terminals were linked to a central unit for processing and control."

With regard to the reactor accident at Chernobyl, the Federal Council stated that the reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was technically not comparable to a light-water reactor like that of the Beznau II power plant. Furthermore the Chernobyl reactor had never undergone a safety review process as normally carried out in western countries. The Chernobyl power plant was therefore not relevant in the context of the assessment of the risks of western nuclear power plants. The Federal Council also pointed out that, in accordance with the Agreement of 10 August 1982 between the government of the Swiss Confederation and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on mutual information on the construction and operation of nuclear installations in the vicinity of the border, the German authorities had been provided with the relevant documents relating to the requested operating licence for the Beznau II power plant. From the beginning, this subject had been discussed during the sessions"

The applicants joined NAA's executive committee. On 3 August 2001, the applicants notified the company P. about the establishment of a union branch within the company, its composition, and their appointment to the executive committee of that workplace branch. Mr. Juan Manuel Palomo Sánchez was the trade-union representative, Mr. Francisco Antonio Fernández Olmo served as the treasurer, Mr. Agustín Alvarez Lecegui was the press and communications officer, and Mr. Francisco José María Blanco Balbas was the organisation officer. Since the union's formation, there have been no changes to the appointment of union members or their responsibilities. NAA published a monthly newsletter, with the March 2002 (sic) issue featuring a report on the April 2, 2002, judgment of the Barcelona Employment Tribunal no. 13, which partly supported the applicants' claims, requiring the company P. to compensate them for certain unpaid salary amounts. The newsletter cover included a cartoon."

The bill of indictment comprised 19 charges (nearly each of them consisted of several counts of burglary) brought against 11 defendants (including the applicant). Five of them were remanded in custody. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 34 witnesses. The case file comprised at that time some 32 volumes.
