Two of the fingers of her left hand were amputated. On 19 September 1988 in Switzerland Mrs Gül gave birth to her third child, Nursal, a daughter. As she still suffered from epilepsy, she could not take care of the baby, who was placed in a home in Switzerland, where she has remained ever since. In a written declaration dated 31 March 1989, a Pratteln specialist in internal medicine stated that a return to Turkey would be impossible for Mrs Gül and might even prove fatal to her, given her serious medical condition. On 9 February 1989 the Minister for Refugees rejected Mr Gül’s application for political asylum, on the ground that he had not been able to establish that he personally had been a victim of persecution, as the general situation of the Kurdish population in Turkey was not in itself sufficient to justify granting political asylum. He went on to say that, according to reliable sources, no measures were being taken by the State authorities against former \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) Mr Nusret Atlı, B) Mr S.

These base rates are used to establish the monthly living expenses of the foreigner concerned and the members of his family seeking to join him, which have to be covered by his income. This must be sufficient to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also a minimum standard of living. In this way the legitimate interest of the public authorities in preventing the family from becoming a burden on the social security services is also taken into account. Mr Gül’s net monthly income is CHF 2,060, which falls CHF 650 short of the amount required for the minimum standard of living as calculated by the social security services. The cost of keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children’s home has not been taken into account, as it is not known who pays for this. The calculation of income is based on pay-slips from 1989, the latest available. On 23 October 1990 the Liestal Cantonal Hospital sent the Basle Rural Aliens Police a medical certificate stating that Mr Gül was 100% unfit for work and would remain so for a period that it was not possible to determine.

The applicant was represented by Ms D. Monget-Sarrail and Ms J. Pépin, lawyers practising in Cayenne. The French Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms E. Belliard, Director of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The applicant alleged a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, read alone and in conjunction with Article 13, in particular because he had had no possibility of challenging the lawfulness of a removal order prior to its execution. On 9 February 2009 the President of the Fifth Section decided to communicate the application to the Government. Applying Article 29 § 1 of the Convention, it also decided to examine the admissibility and merits of the case at the same time. THE FACTS I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicant, a Brazilian national, was born in 1988 and lives in Remire Montjoly in French Guiana.

On 22 October 2001 a doctor who examined the applicant’s X‑rays noted that he had a closed fracture on the right eleventh costal cartilage. On 5 November 2001 the Kadıköy public prosecutor requested authorisation from the Istanbul governor in order to be able to prosecute the police officers allegedly responsible for the applicant’s ill-treatment. This request was made pursuant to Law No. 4483 on the Trial of State Employees and other Public Servants. On 19 November 2001 the applicant was examined by a doctor who found that the applicant was suffering from lumbago and recommended ten days’ rest. On 11 December 2001 an Istanbul deputy police chief was appointed to carry out a preliminary investigation on behalf of the governor of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment. On the same day the deputy police chief prepared his report and submitted it to the governor’s office. It recommended that authorisation for prosecution should be declined. It appears from the report that, in the course of its preparation, the police chief had regard to an incident report of 14 October 2001, drawn up by the \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) Istanbul, B) Samsun, C) Warrington, Cheshire, D) Devon<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: A) Istanbul<|im_end|>",

On 7 March 1994 the District Court transferred the file to the public notary for supplementary investigations. On 27 April 1994 additional expert opinions were submitted. On 13 May 1994 the applicant commented thereupon. From September to November 1994 new forest pest control measures were carried out in the forest belonging to the farm. Again an estate curator was appointed and the succession proceedings were suspended. On 17 November 1994 the District Court ordered the public notary to submit his final submissions. On 2 February 1995 the District Court, having heard additional experts, again dismissed the applicant's request and appointed M. as principal heir. The applicant appealed. On 12 July 1995 the Regional Court quashed the decision and remitted the case to the District Court. On 10 August 1995 the file was transmitted to the notary public. On 5 February 1996 the District Court held a further hearing. Thereafter, it obtained further expert reports and the applicant commented repeatedly on these reports and repeatedly requested further opinions. On 12 August 1997 the applicant submitted a private expert opinion and requested to discuss it at an oral hearing.

Likewise, at the hearing of his case on 2 April 2007 the applicant had again declared that he considered himself to be detained unlawfully and had kept trivialising his offences. His personal circumstances could not lead to a different assessment either. His contacts outside prison had deteriorated as his relationship with his fiancée had ended. The applicant had subsequently insulted and threatened her. Furthermore, the applicant’s age and his state of health did not necessitate the suspension on probation of his preventive detention. The Regional Court had regard, in this connection, to a report dated 21 February 2007 submitted by the Aachen Prison doctor. The latter had stated that the applicant suffered from prostate cancer, which was being stabilised by hormonal medication. He had had an artificial hip fitted in October 2006 without any complications. It had also been possible to treat his heart disease with medication. The likelihood of the seventy‑four‑year‑old applicant dying in the years to come was slightly increased because of his illnesses.

Court sessions were held on 6 November, 6 and 21 December 1995, 14 February and 17 April 1996. On the latter date, the Bankruptcy Court adjourned the proceedings pending the preparation of accounts. In a report of 5 November 1996, the trustee stated that full coverage for the Partnership creditors was expected in connection with the closing of the partners’ estates. He was therefore endeavouring to obtain a compulsory composition so that the bankruptcy proceedings could be finalised pursuant to section 144 of the Bankruptcy Act. The accounts of the applicant’s bankruptcy estate could not be prepared, however, until formal accounts were available in the estates of the co-partners Hugo Petersen’s Børsmæglerselskab A/S, CHN and FVM. At the relevant time, those accounts were being prepared, but could not be completed until, inter alia, the outcome of proceedings initiated by the Ministry of Taxation against Hugo Petersen’s Børsmæglerselskab A/S in bankruptcy was known. The latter proceedings were finalised in 1999.

Between May and August 1989 three hearings were held. An expert opinion was submitted to the court during that period. As the parties were subsequently invited to settle the case, between 15 November 1990 and 6 May 1991 the proceedings were stayed at their request in order to negotiate a settlement. On 29 June 1991 the Tarnobrzeg District Court delivered a judgment dismissing the applicant’s action. The applicant appealed on 28 August 1991. At the appeal hearing of 28 October 1991 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court decided to stay the proceedings pending the termination of other proceedings for the establishment of the defendant’s ownership of the land. Those proceedings ended on 26 October 1998 with the Supreme Court’s decision rejecting the applicant’s cassation appeal as inadmissible. On 3 December 1999 the proceedings were resumed upon the applicant’s request of 16 November 1999.

The first applicant was represented by Mr H. İşler, a lawyer practising in Ankara. The second applicant was represented by Mr A. Okat, a lawyer practising in Kütahya. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On 13 May 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the applications to the Government. It was also decided to examine the merits of the applications at the same time as their admissibility (Article 29 § 3). THE FACTS I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASES The applicants were born in 1980 and 1975, respectively, and live in Ankara and Kütahya. The first applicant lost the sight of his right eye and the second applicant was injured in the legs during their compulsory military service. Upon the refusal of the Retirement Fund (Emekli Sandığı) to grant them special disability benefits, they applied to the Supreme Military Administrative Court, separately, for annulment of the Retirement Fund's decisions.

The other search warrant was executed at 71 Queen Adelaide Court. It resulted in the arrest of the tenant, Bernadette Roberts, who was the girlfriend of Jobbins, and the recovery of a large amount of stolen property. Johnson was arrested on 6 January 1989 after an extensive car chase by several police officers. At the time, he was carrying a revolver. In his statement he agreed that he had been to No. 25 on several occasions and, on the night in question, was probably there until late. He denied involvement in the offences and said in police interviews that he might have spent the night with a girlfriend. C. The trial The trial of the two applicants and Johnson took place at the Central Criminal Court in February 1990. The prosecution case was that the three men had been involved in each incident. It was argued that there was evidence to link the offences: the Austin Princess stolen from Hurburgh was found at the scene of the Napier robbery; the Toyota stolen from the Napiers was found abandoned close to the \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) Mr K.

It also stated that the applicants’ manager had informed the magazine that the applicants did not wish to comment on their wedding. The applicants brought compensation proceedings against the magazine before Oslo District Court (Oslo tingrett) and invoked, among other things, the right to respect for private life under section 390 of the Penal Code and Article 8 of the Convention. It was not in dispute that the magazine was not invited to the wedding and that the photographs were taken without the applicants’ knowledge approximately 250 meters from the islet. By judgment of 22 November 2006 the Oslo District Court found for the applicants and ordered the magazine to pay them each 50,000 Norwegian kroner (NOK). In addition, the editor responsible was ordered to pay each applicant NOK 15,000 and the journalist and the photographer were ordered to pay each applicant NOK 5,000.

On 8 March 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court rejected her complaint for a procedural mistake. On 11 April 2005 the applicant again lodged a complaint with the Warsaw Regional Court under section 5 of the 2004 Act. She sought a ruling declaring that the length of the proceedings before the Pruszków District Court had been excessive and that just satisfaction in the amount of 10,000 Polish zlotys (PLN - approx. EUR 2,500) should be awarded to her. On 9 June 2005 the Warsaw Regional Court gave a decision in which it acknowledged the excessive length of the proceedings, finding that there had been some periods of unjustified inactivity (lasting from several months to some two years) on the part of the Pruszków District Court and awarded the applicant PLN 3,000 (approx.

On 16 May 2001 the Gebze prosecutor questioned the applicant about these complaints. The applicant maintained his complaints and informed the prosecutor that on his return from the hospital he had been beaten up again by the gendarmes. He added that according to information he had obtained subsequently, an officer named either “Abdullah” or “Abdurrahman” had shot him with his pistol. He also told the prosecutor that bullet marks were still visible in the ceiling of the prison. An officer by the name of A.Y. who had taken part in the operation was questioned by the Gebze prosecutor on 17 July 2001. The officer told the prosecutor that he had heard a shot from the other side of the barricades, but added that he had not used his weapon during the operation. No bullets or spent bullet cases had been found after the operation. In his indictment of 17 July 2001 the Gebze prosecutor indicted the applicant and over 200 of his fellow inmates.

Meanwhile, in a decision (auto de procesamiento) of 2 February 1993, the investigating judge in Puerto de la Cruz had formally charged the applicant with, inter alia, rape and forgery of documents. On 8 February 1993 the investigating judge renewed his request to have a further statement by the complainant through the channels of international judicial cooperation (see paragraph 11 above). The requested statement and two medical certificates, all in Finnish, were received in Puerto de la Cruz on 29 April 1993. A Spanish translation did not become available until two months later. The statement - which was taken at a court hearing in Tuusula, Finland, on 14 December 1992 - confirmed Ms T.’s original allegations (see paragraph 7 above).

The children remained with the applicant who, in December 1993, had applied to the Child Support Agency (“the CSA”) to obtain financial support from their father for bringing up the children. There had been an oral agreement that he pay GBP 150 maintenance per week towards the support of the children. According to the applicant, some payments had been voluntarily made but they had rapidly ceased. She only had a limited income from a part-time evening job and child benefit and even when she obtained full-time secretarial employment in 1994 she was struggling financially. The CSA did not send a Maintenance Enquiry Form (MEF) to Mr K until 25 May 1995, which resulted in the applicant losing the opportunity to receive maintenance for the period prior to that date. On 13 July 1995 Mr K returned the MEF accepting paternity. Insufficient information was given to allow a full maintenance assessment to be made. An interim maintenance assessment (IMA) was issued with effect from 5 October 1995. Mr K’s liability changed many times after that date, inter alia as his employment changed and it proved difficult to obtain information.

On 13 November 1974, Mr. Nölkenbockhoff was arrested under a warrant issued by the Essen District Court on 11 November; he was suspected among other things of bankruptcy offences. Other senior managers in the company were also arrested. On 17 May 1976, the indictment, which was 489 pages long, was served on Mr. Nölkenbockhoff and four co-defendants. The trial hearings began on 29 October 1976 before the 6th Criminal Chamber (6. Grosse Strafkammer) of the Essen Regional Court (Landgericht). They lasted until 11 July 1980, two or three hearings being held each week. The court heard evidence from hundreds of witnesses, and several thousand documents were read out. The applicant’s husband was defended by two counsel, one of whom was assigned by the court. On 11 July 1980, the Regional Court delivered its judgment, which ran to 579 pages.

The court held as follows: “... On the day of the President’s visit... the defendant... saw fit to wave a small placard containing an exact copy, served cold, of a famous retort prompted by a direct affront. If the defendant had not intended to cause offence, but solely to give an incongruous lesson in manners, he would surely have preceded the phrase ‘casse toi pov’con’ with words to the effect ‘you shouldn’t say’. Having adopted the phrase strictly as his own, he cannot reasonably maintain that he had no intention of causing offence. The apparently underlying issue of double standards does not even arise, since the purpose of the law is to protect the office of President, and Mr Eon, as an ordinary citizen, cannot claim the right to be treated on an equal footing. The offence of insulting the President of the French Republic has therefore been fully made out...” As to the sentence, the court noted that in view of the applicant’s circumstances and modest income (EUR \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) 60th, B) male-to-female transsexual, C) President of the French Republic, D) independent insurance and building-loans broker<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: C) President of the French Republic\nOutput: C<|im_end|>  ``` H",

The provisions of the Act extended to, inter alia, judges, prosecutors and advocates. In May 1999 the applicant in his lustration declaration stated that he had not been an intentional and secret collaborator of the communist-era security services. On 11 May 2005 the Commissioner of Public Interest (Rzecznik Interesu Publicznego) notified the applicant that he had instituted proceedings aimed at verifying the truthfulness of the applicant’s declaration. The Commissioner heard the applicant on 2 June 2005. The applicant stated that in the 1980s he had been harassed by two officers of the security service. However, he averred that his contacts with the security service had not amounted to secret and conscious collaboration. He stated that he had ceased all the contacts with the security services in August 1984. The applicant unsuccessfully requested the Commissioner to hear eight advocates of the Koszalin Regional Bar Association. On 8 August 2005 the Commissioner made an application to the Lustration Chamber of the Warsaw Court of Appeal, \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) advocates, B) asthmatic, C) Herpes virus?

The Board quashed the Building Committee’s 15 April 1992 decision on the grounds that the tentative approval was contrary to the existing property plan and detailed development plan and the neighbours should have been given the opportunity to express their views on the matter before it was decided. 3. Judicial appeals against the above decisions On 3 March 1999 the Building Committee appealed against the Board’s above-mentioned decision of 10 February 1999 to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Skåne. The applicant obtained extensions of time-limits for filing his written submissions in April and May 1999, and in September he asked the court to give priority to the case. Following the Board’s above-mentioned decision of 31 March 2000 on the tentative approval, the applicant appealed against this decision to the County Administrative Court. The latter granted him four extensions between 5 May and 23 August 2000 of the time-limits for specifying his appeal grounds. The County Administrative Court examined both of the above appeals concurrently and on 11 October 2000 it delivered two judgments, one on each appeal.

On his return to the van his colleague had put the bag containing the money in the back of the van. On their return to the bank's headquarters in Trabzon he and his colleagues had realised that the sum of 20,000 Turkish liras (TRL) was missing. They had then gone back to the branch and looked for the money, without success. On 3 September 1998 the Trabzon prosecutor filed an indictment formally charging the applicant and his two colleagues with the offence of breach of trust. On 22 December 2000, while the criminal proceedings against the applicant and his colleagues were in progress, Law no. 4616 entered into force. Law no. 4616 provides for the suspension of criminal cases in respect of certain offences committed before 23 April 1999. On 22 December 2003 the Seventh Chamber of the Istanbul Assize Court considered the following: “...[the applicant] has committed the offence of breach of trust.

On 27, 28 and 29 May 2002 the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed the applicant's requests for the presiding judge to withdraw. On 11 September 2002 the Court of Appeal prolonged the applicant's and his nine co-defendants' detention until 31 December 2002. In addition to the grounds previously relied on, it considered that the applicant's detention was justified under Article 258 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure since that provision established a presumption to the effect that the likelihood of a severe penalty being imposed on the applicant might induce him to obstruct the proceedings. It also noted that the prolongation of his detention was justified by the volume of evidence to be heard at the trial. On 18 December 2002 the Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant and his 17 co-defendants be kept in custody until 30 June 2003. It held that the grounds invoked in its previous decisions were still valid.

Subsequently, on 27 April 2000 the Amstetten District Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) requested the applicant to comment on the above charges. On 15 May 2000 the applicant filed his defence. He stated that he had been in a rush, since his passenger was sick and he wanted to take him home as fast as possible. Furthermore, he claimed that he had been driving at a maximum of 160 km/h. In addition, he submitted that he had been constantly overtaking cars, which was why he had been driving in the left-hand lane. The applicant contended that he had not used any fog-lights. In a decision of 5 October 2000 the Amstetten District Authority convicted the applicant of four traffic offences, namely speeding, breaching the requirement to drive in the right-hand lane, unjustified use of fog-lights and failure to carry his driving licence with him, and imposed fines amounting in total to 7,000 Austrian schillings (508.71 euros) on him, with 236 hours’ imprisonment in default. Moreover, it ordered him to pay procedural costs.

Subsequently, on 11 February 1999, she filed an objection (Einspruch) against that decision with the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority. On 22 March 1999 the applicant, upon the District Administrative Authority’s request, filed a statement in which she specified that she had entered Austria with a valid visa on 26 February 1998. As proceedings for a residence permit were underway, she was in her view allowed to stay until the decision had become final. In addition she claimed that, according to certain EC directives and the Constitutional Court’s jurisprudence and in line with the ECJ’s constant case-law, she was legally residing in Austria, since her father had Austrian citizenship. The Aliens Police submitted their observations on 16 August 1999, which were served on the applicant’s counsel on 23 August 1999. They stated that neither European Law nor domestic provisions could justify the applicant’s sojourn in Austria, which was in fact in breach of section 31 of the Aliens Act.

Article 5 of this law provided the possibility of leasing State land to farmers who were in need and who fulfilled certain eligibility criteria (“right holders”). In particular, Article 24 § 1 of Law no. 3083 provided that those who had been convicted of certain offences were not entitled to benefit from this law (see paragraph 16 below). Following the promulgation of Law no. 3083, the applicants applied to the Commission that was responsible for the determination of farmers who were eligible to be right holders under the Law in question and requested to be provided with land in Ceylanpınar in the south-east of Turkey. They were subsequently identified as right holders and leased land from the Directorate General for Agricultural Reform (Tarım Reformu Genel Müdürlüğü) (“the Directorate General”) for an indefinite period on payment of a rent. The applicants earned their living by cultivating these fields. On 25 March 1997, after conducting a “security investigation”, the Directorate General annulled the right holder status of the applicants. On 2 May 1997 the applicants lodged separate cases with the Gaziantep Administrative Court and requested \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 25 March 1997, B) 14 December 1995, C) 14 March 1988, D) 20 January 1995<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: A) 25 March 1997, <|im_end|>  1 <|",

The court further took into account that the accused were partly responsible for the length of the proceedings because they had lodged vexatious applications for new evidence to be heard and had not complied with time-limits for filing new submissions. The applicant's numerous applications for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were to no avail. The Opole Regional Court held 23 hearings in 2001 and 21 hearings in 2002. On 31 July 2002 the Opole Regional Court gave a judgment in which it found the applicant guilty of several counts of repeated group rape with aggravated cruelty and false imprisonment committed while acting in an organised criminal gang. The applicant was also convicted of administering an unknown psychotropic substance to some of the victims and use of a forged identity document. The court acquitted the applicant of being the leader of the organised criminal gang. The applicant was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment. The applicant and other co‑accused appealed. On 2 June 2003 the Wrocław Court of Appeal gave a judgment. It amended the first-instance judgment with respect to the applicant reducing his prison sentence to 10 years and 8 months.

On 6 December 1993 the Bitlis prosecutor decided that he did not have the requisite jurisdiction ratione materiae to investigate the case and forwarded the investigation file to the prosecutor’s office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court, which did have jurisdiction to investigate such offences.

He waived his right to a lawyer. He reiterated that he had been ill-treated at the Samsun police headquarters and that, although he was not completely certain, the accused appeared to be one of the police officers who had ill-treated him. In this connection, the applicant claimed that about twelve police officers had ill‑treated him, but that at the time when he had been asked to identify the perpetrators he had been on hunger strike, depressed and suffering from health problems. He reiterated that he was not certain whether the accused was one of those who had ill-treated him and affirmed that he wanted those responsible to be prosecuted. In addition, he stated that he did not wish to join the proceedings as a civil party. On 26 September 2007 the Samsun Assize Court acquitted H.Ö. of the charges against him. In its decision the court held that while the forensic medical reports established that the applicant had been ill‑treated between 5 and 6 October 1999, the applicant could not formally identify the accused as responsible and, as such, there was insufficient evidence \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 14 January 1974, B) 24 January 1983, C) 26 September 2007, D) 2 July 2002<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: C\n(Note: I will not output any new lines)",

(name changed, ed.) had been ill-treated by police officers in Cameroon, kicked by them in the abdomen and placed with 18 other women in ‘stinking, damp cells’ for having demonstrated on behalf of her son, abducted by the authorities. She had survived her escape on a container ship, during which she ‘nearly went mad’ because in mid-ocean she ‘no longer knew whether it was night or day outside’. Finally, after a lorry journey lasting several days, she found herself in Vienna, where all at once, she was ‘surrounded by white people’. She thought she was safe. Her case was so well documented that Austria, in the form of the normally very strict Federal Refugee Office, granted her asylum quickly and without red tape. But then this country revealed its other side. Elaine B., 35, a well-groomed businesswoman and mother of three, holds on tight to her handbag during the interview and breaks down in tears repeatedly, says her life is a mess [and that] she can no longer trust the authorities here because they treat her like \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) Lancashire Structure Plan, B) International Agricultural Show, C) opiate diamorphine, D) no longer knew whether it was night or day outside<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: D) no longer knew whether it was night or day outside<|im_end|>  |",

On 11 December 1996 the Regional Appeals Commission dismissed the applicant's claim as it found that the applicant had failed to obtain the necessary visa from a chief physician. On 9 May 1997 the applicant filed a complaint with Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) and on 13 October 1999 that court quashed the Regional Appeals Commission's decision. The Constitutional Court found that the alleged unlawfulness of the restriction excluding general practitioners from administering certain types of therapy was a preliminary question which the Appeals Commission had failed to address. On 3 May 2000 the applicant filed a request for proceedings to be resumed and, on 8 November 2000, the Appeals Commission held an oral hearing in which it decided to appoint an expert for examining the question of urgency of the chirurgical interventions forming the basis of the dispute. Since the expert did not deliver the report, the applicant, on 15 January 2001, urged the Appeals Commission to continue its examination. After the expert finally delivered the report a further hearing in camera was scheduled for 15 May 2002.

The court considered that, given the fact that the applicant had been living in Germany, there was a real risk that he might go into hiding. In addition, it found that the case was complex as it concerned an organised criminal group and that, once released, the applicant might tamper with evidence or otherwise obstruct the proceedings. The applicant appealed against the detention order. However, on 22 August 2001 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the appeal. On 18 October 2001 and 16 January 2002 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court prolonged the applicant’s detention. The court repeated grounds given previously: the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences, the severity of the anticipated sentence, the complexity of the case and the risk that the applicant might go into hiding as he had no permanent residence in Poland. His appeals against both decisions were dismissed. On 18 February 2002 the applicant and his accomplices were indicted before the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court.

Furthermore, she asked to receive copies of all documents relating to the estate. She asserted that between 2002 and 2007 she had regularly visited her father at his retirement home and had talked to him on the telephone. Subsequently, her own health had prevented her from visiting. Telephone calls had been impossible because her father’s health had meant he had no longer been able to use a telephone. The retirement home had been in possession of her address and telephone number, and had phoned her on several occasions. In a decision of 28 January 2009 the Memmingen District Court dismissed the applicant’s application, as there were no indications that the applicant’s father’s wife could not protect the inheritance. In addition, being born before 1 July 1949 and thus not being a statutory heir, she had no right to receive copies of documents about the estate. On 6 February 2009 the applicant appealed to the Memmingen Regional Court, arguing in \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 16 August 2007, B) 2007, C) two years’, D) 30 December 2002<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: B) 2007<|im_end|> \n5.

In view of defence counsel’s refusal to accept the offer made by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to explain the content of the case files orally, the Regional Court found that it was impossible to assess whether the information given in this manner would be sufficient. At the present stage of the proceedings, counsel for the defence could not, however, claim to be entitled to unlimited access to the complete case files. The Regional Court’s decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 16 September 2002. 4. The Court of Appeal’s review of the detention order On 16 September 2002 the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a further appeal against the detention order. He again claimed that he had a constitutional right to be given access to the facts and evidence on which the detention order was based. On 17 September 2002 the Mönchengladbach Regional Court decided, without giving further reasons, not to amend its decision of 9 September 2002. On 18 September 2002 the Mönchengladbach Public Prosecutor’s Office, which had the case files, drafted a report which was sent to the Düsseldorf Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office with the files the next day. \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) between 29 June 2009, B) August 2007, C) 16 September 2002, D) 6 October 2004<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: C\n<|im_end|>user\n<|im_start|>system\nA)",

An officer by the name of A.Y. who had taken part in the operation was questioned by the Gebze prosecutor on 17 July 2001. The officer told the prosecutor that he had heard a shot from the other side of the barricades, but added that he had not used his weapon during the operation. No bullets or spent bullet cases had been found after the operation. In his indictment of 17 July 2001 the Gebze prosecutor indicted the applicant and over 200 of his fellow inmates. The inmates were accused of obstructing law-enforcement personnel in the execution of their duties and causing criminal damage. During a search conducted at the prison on 29 August 2001 a pistol and seven bullets were found by the prison authorities. On 6 December 2001 gendarme officer S.Y., who had been responsible for the security of the applicant's prison, was questioned by the Gebze prosecutor. Officer S.Y. informed the prosecutor that a total of three pistols had been found during searches conducted in the prison some months after the operation. It was possible that the applicant had been shot with one of those pistols by the \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) Gebze prosecutor, B) Braunschweig Police, C) Şanlıurfa Security Directorate, D) Military Administrative Court<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: A) Gebze prosecutor.",

Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1 of the Rules of Court. Having consulted the parties, the President of the Chamber decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice, the proceedings in the present case should be conducted simultaneously with those in the cases of Jordan v. the United Kingdom (no. 24746/94), McKerr v. the United Kingdom (no. 28883/95) and Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom (no. 37715/97). Third-party comments were received from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission on 23 March 2000, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 61 § 3).

As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (“the Government“), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 28 February 1995 and the Government’s memorial on 7 March 1995. The Secretary to the Commission later informed him that the Delegate would submit her observations at the hearing. On 2 May 1995 the Commission produced to the Court the documents in the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions. In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 May 1995. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.

Stressing that the applicant had evaded justice at the initial stage of the proceedings, the court also pointed out that his detention served the purpose of securing the proper conduct of the trial. Furthermore, the court found it necessary to extend his detention until 30 October 2000 because the summer holidays were approaching, which, for all practical purposes, meant that the examination of the case would be postponed. On 15 September 2000 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant's further application for release. On 21 September 2000 the applicant requested that the three sets of criminal proceedings conducted against him before the courts in Szczecin, including the proceedings at issue, be transferred to other courts. On 13 October 2000 his request was refused. On 18 October 2000 the Szczecin Regional Court prolonged the applicant's detention until 30 January 2001. It reiterated all the grounds previously given for his detention. The applicant's appeal, based on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 31 October 2000.

The Government informed the Court that the proceedings against the gendarmes who had lost the file were terminated by a decision of non‑prosecution on 15 January 2002 on account of the expiry of the statutory time-limit. The applicants claimed that they were never informed of the outcome of the proceedings and that they learned of the decision of the İzmir Administrative Council when the Court delivered its judgment in the case of Satık and Others (no. 31866/96, 10 October 2000) which had been lodged by ten other prisoners who had been injured on 20 July 1995 in Buca prison.

He was detained at the Gaziantep Foreigners’ Removal Centre (“the Gaziantep Removal Centre”) at the time of the events giving rise to this application. His current address is unknown. In 2000 the applicant fled to Turkey because he was being searched for by the Russian authorities. It appears that shortly before his escape, he had lost his right leg in a bomb attack that struck a mosque in Chechnya. Subsequent to his departure from Russia, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant by the Russian authorities before the Cerkessk City Court on the following charges: (i) participation in an armed insurrection and membership of an armed organisation with the purpose of overthrowing the constitutional order and violating the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and (ii) possessing firearms and ammunition. It appears that the Cerkessk City Court issued a detention order in respect of the applicant in his absence. On 24 January 2008 the applicant was taken into police custody in Istanbul in the context of an operation against al-Qaeda. He was subsequently taken to Gaziantep, where he was placed in pre-trial detention at the Gaziantep H-Type Prison upon the order of the \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) Gökçeada, B) Bangkok, C) Istanbul Security Headquarters, D) Istanbul<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: D) Istanbul\n<|im_end|>  | 5: This activity is not recognizable",

Referring to its leading decision given on 5 February 2004 in relation to the case of M. (file no. 2 BvR 2029/01; application no. 19359/04 before this Court), it found that Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, as amended on 26 January 1998, were constitutional. C. The second set of proceedings (application no. 42225/07) 1. The decision of the Freiburg Regional Court On 12 July 2006 the Freiburg Regional Court, having consulted a psychiatric expert, W., again refused to suspend the applicant's preventive detention and grant probation under Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code. 2. The decision of the Karlsruhe Court of Appeal On 11 December 2006 the Karlsruhe Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal.

In 2002 the Warsaw District Court held hearings on 18 March and 7 October. Subsequently, the court held hearings at regular intervals. In 2003 it held in total four hearings. In 2004 eight hearings were held; however, the majority of them were adjourned due to the absence of the defendant or witnesses. On 13 January 2005 the Warsaw District Court held a hearing. On 11 February 2005 the applicant lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) a complaint about a breach of her right to have her case heard within a reasonable time. She relied on the 2004 Act. On 17 March 2005 the Regional Court dismissed her complaint. The court examined the course of the impugned proceedings and held that there were no delays for which the District Court could be held responsible. Some delays were caused by the actions of the defendant. The court finally held that the case was complex. The decision was notified to the applicant on 31 March 2005. The applicant was also informed that the domestic law did not provide any appeal against the decision. On 11 April 2005 the court held \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 11 April 2005, B) 27-28 January, C) 23 April 1991, D) December 2003<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: A) 11 April 2005<|im_end|>  |  | <|",

At the hearing held on 9 December 1997 the defendants informed the court that the second set of proceedings was still pending because they had lodged a cassation appeal. Consequently, on 12 January 1998, the District Court again decided to stay the proceedings. The applicant appealed against this decision, but on 23 March 1998 his appeal was rejected as he had failed to pay the fees for the appeal. Subsequently, the applicant applied to the court to issue a writ of enforcement of the default judgment of 31 January 1994. On 22 May 1998 the Katowice District Court dismissed his application on the grounds that the proceedings were stayed. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision. On 8 October 1998 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) quashed the decision of 22 May 1998 and remitted the application concerning the writ of enforcement for reconsideration. On 11 January 1999 the applicant applied to resume the proceedings. He submitted that the second set of the proceedings had ended with the Supreme Court’s decision of 14 October 1998. On 12 January 1999 the court allowed the application and resumed the proceedings. \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 11 March 1988, B) 6 May 2010, C) 21 July 2004, D) 22 May 1998<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: D) 22 May 1998<|im_end|>\nSelect the correct option based on",

The company had not observed the principles of journalistic diligence since it had never suggested that there were differing views among the historians who had distanced themselves from the ‘myth’ that had built up with regard to Switzerland’s position during the Second World War. (c) The Swiss Radio and Television Company disputes that the programme in issue can be regarded as politically committed journalism, which is subject to particularly stringent rules of diligence. It argues that, in any event, the programme complied with such rules. The company also complains of a misuse of discretionary power. It accuses the relevant authority of having reaffirmed the conclusions of its decisions of 24 October 1997 despite the fact that the additional investigation had virtually demolished the reasoning on which they were based, and of having acted arbitrarily by assuming the role of the ultimate authority on historical science.

An appeal by the applicant against this order appears to have been dismissed. On 25 September and 22 November 1989 Mr van der Tang lodged with investigating judge no. 1 his first applications for provisional release. Arguing that he had throughout been unaware of the real nature of the consignment, he insisted that he was not involved with any drug-trafficking organisation. He further complained that during his four-month detention he had only been questioned twice by the judge - in May and June 1989 - and was the only person still held in custody despite the relatively minor character of his offence. Mr van der Tang also undertook to comply with any conditions attached to his release. These applications were rejected on 9 October and 25 November 1989 respectively by means of orders not containing reasons. A similar application for provisional release followed on 22 December 1989 and was rejected on 27 December 1989 by an auto (reasoned decision). The ground for the decision was the seriousness of the offences - illegal possession of a firearm and drug trafficking in large quantities; \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 30 December 2002, B) 22 November 1989, C) between 17 and 23 March 2004, D) 27 May 1983<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: B) 22 November 1989<|im_end|> -manager (refering to",

There were 16 defendants in the case, all charged with numerous counts of fraud committed in an organised criminal group. On 20 May 2005 the Warsaw District Court again prolonged the applicant’s detention until 9 June 2005 reiterating the grounds previously given for her detention. Since on 10 June 2005 the applicant’s detention had reached the statutory time-limit of two years laid down in Article 263 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a further prolongation of her detention and also detention of her co-accused E.C., A.F. and P.S until 9 December 2005 was ordered by the Warsaw Court of Appeal on 3 June 2005. The court found that the strong suspicion against her of having committed the serious offences with which she had been charged and the severity of the anticipated sentence justified holding her in custody. It pointed out that the case was complex given the number of accused and the number of charges brought against them. Moreover, it added that 450 witnesses were to be heard and numerous documents were to be examined. On 12 August 2005 the trial court held the first hearing.

On 21 April 2008 the English Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) sent a formal letter of request to the Ministry of Justice of the Land North Rhine‑Westphalia, Germany, in accordance with the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 1959, requesting assistance in obtaining information with respect to U.’s medical qualifications and the authenticity of the related certificates submitted by him to the British authorities when applying to be admitted as a locum doctor. The letter gave a short summary of the circumstances of Mr Gray’s death and specified that while no criminal proceedings had yet been instigated in the United Kingdom, the offence investigated constituted manslaughter, i.e. the unlawful killing of a human being, an offence contrary to Common Law and punishable on conviction by a term of life imprisonment. The CPS asked the German authorities to carry out the respective investigations and to arrange for hearings of the relevant witnesses in Germany in the presence of representatives of Cambridgeshire Constabulary. The request was forwarded by the North Rhine-Westphalia Ministry of Justice to the Hamm General Prosecution Authorities (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) as well as to the locally competent Bochum prosecution authorities.

It followed that parental authority had to be withdrawn from both parents and transferred to the Youth Office. Finally, the District Court considered that, taking into account the child’s serious objections, the applicant’s tendency to massively interfere with the child’s life in the foster family and the need to stabilise and strengthen the child, access rights would very probably jeopardise the child’s well-being and had to be suspended for one year. This decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 9 July 2003. On 8 August 2003 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Berlin Court of Appeal (Kammergericht). She emphasised that the child’s placement in the foster family had been devised as a temporary measure and considered the measures taken by the District Court to be disproportionate. On 13 November 2003 the child’s curator submitted her comments. She considered that the child’s persistent wish not to see her parents should be respected. On 9 January 2004 the child’s father submitted his comments. He considered that the child should remain with the foster family, but requested to be granted \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) gas fumes, pestilential smells and contamination, B) Wesen und Aufgaben des Staatsgerichtshofes’ gelesen, C) foster family, D) 1 WLR 172<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: C) foster family\nThis identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage.",

Further, the court referred to the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on the applicant. In the course of investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended by the Ostrołęka Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 4 March 2004, 11 May 2004 and 10 December 2004. In its decisions, the court relied on the likelihood that the applicant had committed the offence while acting with numerous co-suspects in the ambit of the activities of an organised criminal group. Further, it referred to the need to obtain evidence, in particular: to take evidence from numerous witnesses and suspects and to confront a key witness with the injured persons. On 29 September 2004 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to one year and four months’ imprisonment by the Wyszków District Court for failure to pay maintenance and threatening behaviour, charges which has been examined in separate sets of proceedings. The court offset the sentence against the period of pre-trial detention. On 23 June 2005 the applicant and twenty three suspects were indicted before the Ostrołęka Regional Court.

The criminal investigation On 23 April 1994 the Tatvan public prosecutor instigated an investigation into the incident. The prosecutor noted that there were numerous trenches around the area for tank and gun practice. The remains of the ammunition at the scene were secured. Reports and sketches were drafted and a post‑mortem examination was conducted on the deceased. The cause of death was attributed to hemorrhagic shock and the doctor deemed it unnecessary to conduct a classic autopsy of the deceased. On 4 May 1994 the Tatvan public prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the incident and forwarded his decision to the military prosecutor's office at the Van 21st gendarmerie border brigade commandership (“the military prosecutor”). The military prosecutor instigated an investigation into the incident. In particular, he requested the official records regarding the use of grenade launchers by the military during training, and medical reports regarding the health of the first applicant.

At the hearings, the Government produced certain documents to the Court AS TO THE FACTS The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. In 1965, Mr. Sidney Elmer Golder, a United Kingdom citizen born in 1923, was convicted in the United Kingdom of robbery with violence and was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment. In 1969, Golder was serving his sentence in Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight. On the evening of 24 October 1969, a serious disturbance occurred in a recreation area of the prison where Golder happened to be. On 25 October, a prison officer, Mr. Laird, who had taken part and been injured in quelling the disturbance, made a statement identifying his assailants, in the course of which he declared: “Frazer was screaming... and Frape, Noonan and another prisoner whom I know by sight, I think his name is Golder... were swinging vicious blows at me.“ On 26 October Golder, together with other prisoners suspected of having participated in the disturbance, was segregated from the main body of prisoners.

Therefore, on 31 October 2005, on an application from the applicant, the court adjourned the proceedings to 8 December 2005 and made further procedural directions in relation to any further questions to be put to the expert. On 8 December 2005 the final hearing was listed before the High Court in London for 28 February and 1 March 2006. On 28 February and 1 March 2006 the High Court held the final hearings in the case and gave judgment on 28 March 2006. The court found in favour of the applicant, choosing to rely on the expert opinion and to disregard the decisions of the Romanian courts. It found that the applicant had custody rights within the meaning of Article 5 of the Hague Convention and that therefore the child’s removal from Romania had been wrongful under Article 3 of the same Convention. The court also rejected an objection based on Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention raised by the mother and issued an order for the return of the child to Romania.

He stated that the telephones of two of the accused had been intercepted and that the conversations between them and with the applicant had revealed that the latter had threatened İ.Y. upon an order from O.K. In describing the events at issue, the Public Prosecutor once again maintained that A.V.O. had been involved in the transactions and had been threatened by fellow members of the applicant’s criminal organisation. He further indicated that the unfolding of the events had been corroborated by the statements of all of the accused, but that they had all denied having threatened İ.Y. and M.Y. Finally, relying on the telephone recordings and the statements of the other accused, the Public Prosecutor proposed that the applicant should be found guilty as charged. Subsequently, the applicant submitted his statements to the court, requesting the examination of two witnesses, A.V.O., who had been mentioned in the Public Prosecutor’s written opinion, and a certain İ.D. At the hearing on 3 September 2002 the Istanbul State Security Court rejected the request, finding that the examination of the witnesses called by the \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) Schröder, B) Zeilinger, C) Mr Van Ommeslaghe, D) İ.D.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: D) İ.D.",

The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court. On 17 June 2004 the Court decided to communicate the application to the Government. In a letter of 22 June 2004, the Court informed the parties that in accordance with Article 29 §§ 1 and 3 of the Convention it would decide on both the admissibility and merits of the application. THE FACTS I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicants were born in 1956, 1954 and 1955 respectively and live in Munich, Germany. In 1995 the Sakarya Governor’s office expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicants. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot of land and the relevant amount was paid to them when the expropriation took place. Following the applicants’ request for increased compensation, on 11 September 1997 the Sakarya Civil Court of First-instance awarded them an additional compensation of 865,267,950 Turkish liras (TRL)1 plus interest at the statutory rate running from 12 December 1995, the date on which the title-deed to the land had been transferred to the Sakarya \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 10 January 1979, B) 1955, C) 3 September 2003, D) 16 June 1999<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: B) 1955<|im_end|> \nselect the correct option based on the passage",

By “notes verbales“ dated 8, 10 and 13 July, the Embassy formally submitted a second request for the extradition of Mr. Sanchez-Reisse, among others. 16. On 11 August, the Office instructed the Geneva cantonal authorities to hold a second hearing on the applicant’s extradition, this time on the basis of the documents relating to the kidnapping of C. At the hearing the applicant continued to resist extradition. 3. The applicant’s objection to his extradition On 25 September 1981, Mr. Sanchez-Reisse’s lawyer sent the Office a memorandum setting out the reasons for the applicant’s objection to being extradited (see paragraph 14 above). The reasons included the following: the documents submitted in support of the extradition request did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down in the Convention on the Extradition of Criminals between Switzerland and the Republic of Argentina (see paragraph 32 below), since they contained no description of the offences with which the applicant was charged; as regards the two kidnappings of which he was accused by the Argentine authorities, which were moreover of a political character, Mr. Sanchez-Reisse was innocent; if extradition was granted, it would be contrary to Articles 3 and 6 \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) FLEET, B) Reindeer Husbandry Act, C) widow’s bereavement allowance, D) kidnappings<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: D) kidnappings.",

Before the Court the applicant was represented by Mr J. Mackenzie, a lawyer practising in London. The Government were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. On 27 April 1999 the Court declared the applicant’s complaints under Article 5 §§ 3 and 5 admissible and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. By letter dated 6 July 1999, the applicant detailed his claim for just satisfaction pursuant to Article 41 and confirmed that he had no further observations to make. The Government commented on the applicant’s just satisfaction proposals in their letter dated 11 August 1999. After consulting the Agent of the Government and the applicant’s lawyer, the Chamber decided that it was not necessary to hold a hearing. AS TO THE FACTS I.

On 28 March 2002 the applicant’s representative further requested her client’s release referring to Article 5 of the Convention. She stated that the court was not examining their requests for release thoroughly. She contended that the applicant’s release would not in any way pose a danger to public order. She also stated that the applicant was ready give a guarantee to offset any risk of absconding. On 29 March 2002 the Karşıyaka Criminal Court dismissed the applicant’s request relying on the evidence in the file and the seriousness of the offence. On 5 April 2002 the Karşıyaka Criminal Court held another hearing, at the end of which it ordered that the applicant remain in detention on remand. On 9 April 2002 the applicant’s lawyer challenged this decision before the Karşıyaka Assize Court. She maintained that her client was a minor and could not be kept in detention for such a long time. In this respect, she invoked Article 5 of the Convention and Article 37 (b) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Background The following facts were not contested by the parties. The applicant attended Dunderrow National School from 1968. The school was owned, through trustees, by the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Cork and Ross who was recognised by the Department of Education and Science (“the Department”) as the school’s patron. The manager (S.), acting on behalf of the bishop, was the local parish priest. The latter being elderly and infirm, a local priest (Ó.) was the de facto manager who acted on behalf of, and in the interests of, S. The term “manager” used below refers both to Ó. and to the management function he performed. Dunderrow National School had two teachers, one of whom (L.H.) was the school’s principal, a married man. Dunderrow was one of four national schools in the applicant’s parish. In 1971 a parent of a child complained to the manager that L.H. had sexually abused her child. That complaint was not reported to the police, to the Department or to any other State authority and was not acted upon by the manager.

Kızılkaya and Mr İ.H.Altan, lawyers practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. On 28 August 2008 the Court declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of compensation proceedings. It also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of this complaint at the same time (Article 29 § 3). THE FACTS On 22 November 1998 the applicant's husband, who was performing his compulsory military service, died of a heart attack due to a congenital heart defect, which was diagnosed during the subsequent autopsy. On 19 October 1999 the applicant instituted compensation proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court (Askeri Yükesek İdare Mahkemesi). She also requested a retirement pension. On 6 January 2000 the Assembly of Chambers of the Supreme Military Administrative Court (Askeri Yüksek İdare Mahkemesi Daireler Kurulu) rejected the applicant's claim on the ground that she had to introduce, pursuant to relevant domestic legislation, two separate proceedings for each of her claims.

He was represented by a solicitor. He pleaded guilty to three charges of common assault (a civilian offence), two charges of conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline (a military offence) and two charges of threatening to kill (a civilian offence). On 2 November 1991, his solicitor had made a written request to the prosecuting authorities to ensure the appearance of Dr Blunden at the court martial and on 5 November 1991 the prosecuting officer had issued a witness summons requiring her attendance. However, the defence was informed on the morning of the hearing that Dr Blunden would not be attending. Mr Findlay claims that her absence persuaded him to plead guilty to the above charges. However, his solicitor did not request an adjournment or object to the hearing proceeding. The defence put before the court martial the medical reports referred to above (paragraphs 11-13) and called Dr Reid to give evidence. The latter confirmed his view that the applicant suffered from PTSD, that this had been the principal cause of his behaviour, that he had not been \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) Mr. H.

The applicant was represented by Mr S. Çınar, a lawyer practising in Diyarbakır. On 26 February 2002 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility. THE FACTS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicant was born in 1979. At the time of his application to the Court, he was incarcerated in the Batman E-type Prison. On 16 December 1994 police officers from the Batman Security Directorate arrested the applicant on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK (the Kurdish Workers’ Party), and placed him in custody. During his detention, the applicant signed statements and confessed to being a member of the PKK and to collecting money for that organisation. On 30 December 1994 the applicant was questioned by the public prosecutor attached to the Batman Magistrates’ \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) Mr. Ekbatani, B) Mr Mehmet Şah Çelik, C) Mr M.

She went outside for a walk on the banks of the Ilmenau river with the police officers three times during that period. Following the Regional Court’s decision, the police decided to transfer the applicant to the Braunschweig Police Station which was considered being better equipped for police custody. When the applicant complained about breathing problems during the journey, the police called an ambulance. When both the ambulance crew and a police doctor had found that the applicant did not suffer from health problems, the transfer was continued in the ambulance. The applicant was detained in the Braunschweig Police Station from 8 November 2008, 2.10 a.m. until her release on 9 November 2008 at 6.32 p.m. Her cell was equipped with a bed, an empty desk, a chair and an open cupboard and had a barred window with frosted glass.

In doing so, the 1984 Order also implemented the requirements of the European Community Directives of 1979 and 1983 on “Limitation of Noise Emission from Subsonic Aircraft“. It was, however, more stringent in its application inasmuch as non-compliant subsonic jets were banned from the domestic register twelve months earlier than required by the 1979 Directive. Orders of 1986 and 1987 introduced further ICAO standards. In structuring its landing charges, Heathrow Airport Limited has taken account of ICAO noise certification standards to encourage the use of quieter aircraft. Since 1971 restrictions have been placed on night movements of jets, with the aim of phasing out night flights of noisier aircraft. These measures have been adopted in the light of research into the relationship between aircraft noise and sleep disturbance and after consultation of all interested parties, including the Federation of Heathrow Anti-Noise Groups to which the applicants belong. Monitoring of aircraft noise on take-off from Heathrow Airport was first carried out in the early 1960’s. Since 1974 automatic equipment, consisting of thirteen noise monitoring terminals linked to a central processing and control unit, has \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) Heathrow Airport Limited, B) Board of the City of Warsaw, C) Antalya Magistrates’ Court, D) Central Authorities of the Contracting States<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: A) Heathrow Airport Limited.",

The applicant’s detention was subsequently prolonged on 18 December 2001 and 26 March 2002. The court referred to the complexity of the investigation and relied on the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings. On 11 June 2002 the prosecution filed a bill of indictment against the applicant with the Lublin Regional Court. The applicant was charged with acting in an organised and armed criminal group, incitement to murder, deriving profits from prostitution, extortion and unlawful possession of a firearm. The bill of indictment concerned seven other persons. The trial court appointed a legal-aid counsel for the applicant. On 14 June 2002 the Lublin Regional Court extended the applicant’s detention until 30 September 2002, referring to the severity of the anticipated penalty. On 3 September 2002 the Regional Court ordered that the applicant and his co-accused be kept in custody until 3 February 2003.

It awarded the applicant PLN 1,500 by way of pecuniary damage and dismissed the remaining part of her action. Both parties lodged appeals. In August 1996 the President of the Warsaw Regional Court informed the applicant that her case-file was lost. Subsequently, the applicant was requested to provide copies of all documents in order to reconstruct it.

It partly quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and remitted the case to the court of first‑instance. On 24 July 1997 the Warsaw District Court held the first hearing. On 2 October 1997 the court, sitting in camera, ordered an expert opinion.

The gendarme commander who gave evidence before the Delegates denied that this occurred but recalled that he had destroyed hemp crops. The Commission did not make any finding in regard of this aspect as it was not the subject-matter of any specific complaint. Shortly before 8 November 1993, PKK terrorists went to the village of Dadaş in the Hazro district and took away five teachers, the imam and the imam’s brother. All, save one of the teachers, were shot. The imam’s brother, though wounded, survived. Following the discovery of the bodies of the teachers, the gendarmes at Hazro gathered information from their contacts and sources as to what had happened and who had been involved. They had descriptions of the villagers in the area who had been assisting the PKK in holding the group of teachers. On 8 November 1993, an operation, under the command of Lieutenant Altınoluk, was carried out by the Hazro gendarmes in Çitlibahçe, while gendarmes from Lice went to Bağlan nearby. Concerning what happened during the operation at Çitlibahçe, the Commission’s Delegates had earlier found Lieutenant \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 1 September 2009, B) 4 May 1976, C) 8 November 1993, D) 2 March 2005<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: C) 8 November 1993\n<|im_end|>Simulation\nEnded successfully.",

THE FACTS I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Brzeg. On 14 May 1999 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed multiple gang rape (including statutory rape), of inducing the victims to take intoxicants and of persuading the victims not to inform the police about those crimes. On 17 May 1999 the applicant was remanded in custody by the Brzeg District Court. The decision was based on a reasonable suspicion, confirmed by testimonies of the victims and of other suspects, that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, the severity of the sentence he faced and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation. The court pointed to a serious risk that the applicant, if not detained, might attempt to influence the co-accused and the victims. Subsequently, twelve other persons were charged with participation in the crime and eight of them were remanded in custody.

The Court heard addresses by Mr Blasco Lozano, Ms Queipo de Llano López-Cózar and Mr Sánchez Lorente and their replies to questions from Judges López Guerra and Myjer. It also heard statements by Mr Ramírez Heredia and by Mrs Muñoz Díaz, the applicant. THE FACTS I. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Madrid. The applicant and M.D., both members of the Roma community, were married in November 1971 according to their community’s own rites. The marriage was solemnised in accordance with Roma customs and cultural traditions and was recognised by that community. For the Roma community, a marriage solemnised according to its customs gives rise to the usual social effects, to public recognition, to an obligation to live together and to all other rights and duties that are inherent in the institution of marriage.

With regard to the reactor accident at Chernobyl, the Federal Council stated that the reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was technically not comparable to a light-water reactor like that of the Beznau II power plant. Furthermore the Chernobyl reactor had never undergone a safety review process as normally carried out in western countries. The Chernobyl power plant was therefore not relevant in the context of the assessment of the risks of western nuclear power plants. The Federal Council also pointed out that, in accordance with the Agreement of 10 August 1982 between the government of the Swiss Confederation and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on mutual information on the construction and operation of nuclear installations in the vicinity of the border, the German authorities had been provided with the relevant documents relating to the requested operating licence for the Beznau II power plant.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE By a penal order of 8 October 1997, the applicant was fined 1,000 French francs (FRF) for an assault on his wife that did not incapacitate her from work. On 8 December 1997 he applied to the Saverne Police Court to have that order set aside. On 3 July 1998 the applicant was served by a court bailiff with a summons requiring him to attend the Police Court on 15 September 1998 to answer a charge of “intentional assault entailing no unfitness for work” on 24 July 1997. The offence was classified as a “Class 4 minor offence” and carried a maximum fine of FRF 5,000 under Article 131-13 of the Criminal Code. On 11 August 1998 the applicant lodged a legal-aid application with the legal-aid office of the Saverne tribunal de grande instance, in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Aid Act of 10 July 1991 and its implementing decree of 19 December 1991.

Relying on Article 17 of the Constitution (right to liberty and security), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. While he did not appeal against his pre-trial detention, for which he considered sufficient reasons to have been given, the applicant complained of the amount set for bail, arguing that it had been excessive and disproportionate in view of his financial circumstances and had made any prospect of provisional release unrealistic. He alleged that the amount had been fixed without account being taken of his personal circumstances, in disregard of the requirements of the court’s case-law. By a reasoned decision (auto) of 29 September 2003, the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible. It began by observing that, according to its case-law, the fact that the applicant had been released did not render the amparo appeal devoid \nQuestion: Which identifying fact appears verbatim in the passage?\nOptions: A) EUR 3,500, B) TRL 30,000,000, C) four children, D) EUR 22,777,986<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: D) EUR 22,777,986<|im_end|>  <|im_start",

The applicants joined the union’s executive committee. On 3 August 2001 the applicants informed the company P. of the setting-up of a branch of the trade union inside the company, of its composition, and of their appointment as members of the executive committee of that workplace branch. Mr Juan Manuel Palomo Sánchez was the trade-union representative, Mr Francisco Antonio Fernández Olmo the treasurer, Mr Agustín Alvarez Lecegui the press and communications officer and Mr Francisco José María Blanco Balbas the organisation officer.

Both their children were born in Lancashire, and at present their daughter lives with them and works nearby. Their son travels independently, but stays with them frequently. Over the ten years before 1986, the applicants had to move between a number of sites in Lancashire, often staying in unofficial stopping places. As they wanted to set up a family site, in 1986 they bought a piece of land, known as Cinderbarrow Malt Kiln, Yealand Redmayne, Carnforth in Lancashire. The site is 0.365 hectares in area, and is positioned in the countryside between the M6 motorway and the London-Carlisle railway line. When the applicants bought it, they stated that it was generally regarded as being an eyesore. They referred to letters from local residents describing the site as having been used for car breaking and tipping rubbish, being littered and infested with rats. They spent two years cleaning it up and developing it. The Government disputed this assertion, stating that local authority records indicate that it was after the applicants had occupied it that complaints were received about its condition. They stated that the land was previously used for grazing and growing crops.

On 1 September 2001 at about 7 p.m. the applicants went to the Milli Egemenlik Park in Bakırköy (Istanbul) to attend a meeting, namely the so-called “peace festivities” organised by the Bakırköy branch of the Republican People’s Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi). While they were about to enter the park, the applicants were stopped and searched by the police. The officers found fifty-three copies of a bulletin in a black plastic bag. As the applicants appeared suspicious, the police officers arrested them. The applicants were allegedly beaten up, insulted and threatened with death during their arrest. In particular, two police officers applied pressure to their necks from behind and made them lie down. Following the arrival of two more police officers, they dragged both applicants along the ground, kicked and slapped them and put them in a police car. Once in the car, the police officers continued to punch and slap them, hit them with wooden sticks, insult and threaten them. One of the police officers first sat on the head of Sevil Ulaş and then hit her against the roof of \nQuestion: Which specific detail is explicitly supported by the excerpt?\nOptions: A) Austrian Tyrol, B) Tarnowska Wola, C) Milli Egemenlik Park, D) Tanzania<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: C\n<|im_end|>  | 975 users found this answer helpful.

The applicants appealed. On 17 June 1994 the City Mayor quashed that decision finding that the District Mayor should have been excluded from examining the issue as the District Office had been a party to the sale of that part of the property to third parties which was the subject matter of the case. Between 1994 and 1996 the matter remained dormant. Following numerous interventions by the applicants and their complaints about the inactivity of the administration, the District Prosecutor intervened and filed a complaint with the Board of Appeal of the Local Government (Samorządowe Kolegium Odwoławcze). On 13 November 1996 the Board of Appeal found that this complaint was substantiated and it obliged the District Office to give a decision in the applicants' case before 15 December 1996. In the meantime, on 23 October 1996 the District Office rendered a decision on the merits of the case.

On 28 March 1998 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. On 2 April 1998 he was placed in detention on remand. On 15 April 1998 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, charging him under Articles 168 (2), 497 (2), 522, 55 (3), 33 and 40 of the former Criminal Code with membership of an illegal organisation and armed robbery. On 28 March 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Articles 168 (2) and 497 (2) of the former Criminal Code, and sentenced him to eight years and four months' imprisonment for the former offence and to eleven years and eight months' imprisonment for the latter offence. The State Security Court further stated that the provisions of Law no. 4616, which governed conditional release, the suspension of proceedings and the execution of sentences in respect of certain offences committed before 23 April 1999, had to be taken into account in the execution of the sentence in relation to the offence under Article 497 (2).

The court also held that due to the close links between the suspects there was a risk that, if released, they might interfere with the course of the investigation. Thus it was justified to keep them in custody pending the termination of the investigation. That decision was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) on 31 August 2000. The investigation was terminated on 14 September 2000. On 15 September 2000 the prosecution filed a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court. The applicant was charged with 2 burglaries. The bill of indictment comprised 19 charges (nearly each of them consisted of several counts of burglary) brought against 11 defendants (including the applicant). Five of them were remanded in custody. The prosecution asked the court to hear evidence from 34 witnesses. The case file comprised at that time some 32 volumes. The prosecution had obtained voluminous evidence, including various expert reports.

The incident was further reported to the Bismil public prosecutor. On the same day an on-site examination was conducted by the Bismil public prosecutor together with a doctor. According to an onsite body examination, it was established that both legs were severed as a result of the explosion. No other signs of injury were observed on the dismembered body. The doctor decided that it was unnecessary to conduct a full autopsy on the body. Cavit's corpse was then given to Mr Hasip Yılmaz, a member of the Kamberli village assembly. An incident report was further drafted by the gendarmes and was signed by three non-commissioned officers and the village mayor Mr Kütbettin Altunç. On 24 November 1995 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court decided that no prosecution should be brought against Cavit Özalp on account of his membership of the PKK on the ground that he had died on 26 August 1995. On 14 November 1995 the Bismil public prosecutor accused the non-commissioned officer, Mr İlhan Yücel, of failing to take the necessary precautions when Cavit Özalp had been asked to open the cover of the \nQuestion: Which of the following details can be confirmed from the excerpt?\nOptions: A) 11 July 2006, B) 29 January 1992, C) 12 August 1992, D) 24 November 1995<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nThe answer token is: D\nFor this passage and its numerous dates!

On 2 January 1995, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland issued a certificate in which he identified information whose disclosure at the inquest he believed would be contrary to the public interest as compromising the integrity of RUC intelligence operations. On 4 January 1995, the Coroner’s inquest commenced. The applicant and his family were represented by a solicitor and counsel. The RUC were represented. The Coroner sat for three and a half days, hearing evidence from 19 witnesses, including the applicant, 8 civilians, Soldiers V, W and X, 7 police officers and a pathologist. These witnesses were subject to cross-examination. Sergeant A had informed the Coroner that he would not appear. On or about 8 January 1995, the CAJ provided the Coroner with a statement which they had received from another civilian witness, a driver of a black taxi who had been at the scene. On 10 January 1995, the Coroner rejected the request by the applicant’s counsel to withdraw the protection of the identities of the RUC witnesses.

On 12 June 2009 the President of the Second Section decided to give notice of the application to the Government. It was also decided to rule on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time (Article 29 § 1). THE FACTS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE The applicants were born in 1952, 1960, 1962 and 1934 respectively and live in Bursa. In 2004 the General Directorate of Highways seized a plot of land belonging to the applicants without any formal expropriation, for the construction of a highway. The applicants brought an action before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain compensation for the de facto expropriation of their property. They requested 5,500 Turkish liras (TRY) as compensation from the court and reserved their right to increase this claim in due course. On 22 June 2006 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 5,500 as compensation for the de facto expropriation of their land, as requested, plus interest. The applicants initiated execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain that amount (file no. 2009/2802).
